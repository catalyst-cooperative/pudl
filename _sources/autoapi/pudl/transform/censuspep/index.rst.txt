   Create a cleaned up table of FIPS codes.

   There are three stages of amendments done to the raw table:

   * we add in a ``state`` column with the state abbreviation
   * we squish the raw two digit ``state_id_fips`` with the raw three digit
     ``county_id_fips`` to get the full 5 digit code (these codes are all
     codes of integers but there are meaningful leading zeros so they have
     nullable string dtypes).
   * we add in territories that are missing from Census PEP FIPS codes.

   There are state fips codes in the pudl-compiled POLITICAL_SUBDIVISIONS, but we use
   the census based codes here so that everything is coming from the same primary
   source (though I checked and they are all the same).

   Sources of territories:

   * Main page: https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi.html
   * txt file: https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/reference/codes2020/national_county2020.txt

   There are only a small number of territory counties that were not in PEP. For 2020,
   all of the territories are at the bottom of the txt file. PEP had Puerto Rico so
   everything besides PR was migrated over. A fips_level of 050 was added to all of
   the counties to match the fips_level from PEP.
