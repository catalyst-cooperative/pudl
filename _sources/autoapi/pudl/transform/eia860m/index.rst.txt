   Changelog of EIA-860M Generators based on operating status.

   The monthly reported EIA-860M tables includes existing, proposed and retired
   generators. This table combines all monthly reported data and preserves the first
   reported record when any new information about the generator was reported.

   We are not putting this table through PUDL's standard normalization process for EIA
   tables (see :func:`pudl.transform.eia.harvest_entity_tables`). EIA-860M includes
   provisional data reported monthly so it changes frequently compared to the more
   stable annually reported EIA data. If we fed all of the EIA-860M data into the
   harvesting process, we would get failures because the records from EIA-80m are too
   inconsistent for our thresholds for harvesting canonical values for entities. A
   ramification of this table not being harvested is that if there are any entities
   (generators, plants, utilities) that were only ever reported in an older EIA-860M
   file, there will be no record of it in the PUDL entity or SCD tables. Therefore,
   this asset cannot have foreign key relationships with the rest of the core EIA
   tables.
