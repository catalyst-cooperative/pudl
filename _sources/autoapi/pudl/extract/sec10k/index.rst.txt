pudl.extract.sec10k
===================

.. py:module:: pudl.extract.sec10k

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Load pre-processed SEC 10-K assets from Google Cloud Storage.

   These "raw" tables are generated by the SEC 10-K data extraction pipeline which can be
   found in this repository: https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/mozilla-sec-eia

   Upstream data is not partitioned by year, but we want to be able to extract a subset of
   the data for testing, so the :class:`Sec10kSettings` allow specification of which years
   to extract, and those are used to filter the extracted data before returning it.

.. py:function:: extract(ds: pudl.workspace.datastore.Datastore, table: str, years: list[int]) -> pandas.DataFrame

   Extract SEC 10-K data from the datastore.

   Allows filtering by year to enable testing of the pipeline with a smaller amount
   of data, like a pseudo-partition. This is necessary because the SEC 10-K data is
   not partitioned upstream.

   :param ds: Initialized PUDL datastore.
   :param table: Which of the valid tables should be extracted?
   :param years: Which years of data to include in the output.

   :returns: A dataframe containing the SEC 10-K data.


.. py:function:: raw_sec10k_asset_factory(table) -> dagster.AssetsDefinition

   An asset factory for extracting SEC 10-K data by table.


.. py:data:: raw_sec10k_assets
