pudl.extract.gridpathratoolkit
==============================

.. py:module:: pudl.extract.gridpathratoolkit

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Extract GridPath RA Toolkit renewable energy generation profiles from zipped CSVs.

   These hourly time are organized by technology type: Wind and Solar; and level of
   processing: original, aggregated, and extended. This module currently only extracts the
   data which is both aggregated and extended, since it is the closest to being analysis
   ready. In the future we may extract the other versions, or re-implement the entire
   aggregation and extension process within PUDL, so the outputs are being derived from the
   more granular original data, and so a variety of different aggregations can be provided.

   Alongside the Wind + Solar time series, there are also aggregation tables that describe
   which of the original plants & generators were combined to make the aggregated datasets.
   These are stored as single CSVs.

   In addition there's a table of daily weather data, which is also stored as a single CSV.

   An asset factory for GridPath RA Toolkit hourly generation profiles.

   This factory works on the processed hourly profiles that store one capacity factor
   time series per file with the time index stored in a separate file named
   timestamps.csv. We extract the timestamps first and use them as the index of the
   dataframe, concatenating the capacity factor time series as separate columns in a
   (temporarily) wide-format dataframe.

   The stems of the filenames are used as column labels, which are later transformed
   into the ``aggregation_group`` field, indicating which generators were aggregated to
   produce the time series based on the wind and solar capacity aggregation tables.
