.. py:module:: pudl.workspace

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Tools for acquiring PUDL's original input data and organizing it locally.

   The datastore subpackage takes care of downloading original data form various
   public sources, organizing it locally, and providing a programmatic interface
   to that collection of raw inputs, which we refer to as the PUDL datastore.

   These tools are available both as a library module, and via a command line
   interface installed as an entrypoint script called ``pudl_datastore``.
