PUDL Database Tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We've segmented the processed data into the following normalized data tables.
Clicking on the links will show you a description of the table as well as
the names and descriptions of each of its fields.

Background
^^^^^^^^^^

EIA makes much of its data available through an Application Programming Interface (API).
EIA's API is multi-faceted and contains time-series data sets organized by the main
energy categories:

* **Electricity**: U.S. electric system operating data including aggregate national,
  state, and plant-level electricity generation statistics, including fuel quality and
  consumption, for grid-connected plants with nameplate capacity of 1 megawatt or greater.
* **Natural gas**: statistics of U.S. natural gas production, imports, exploration,
  pipelines, exports, prices, consumption, stocks, and reserves.
* **Petroleum**: statistics of U.S. petroleum and other liquid fuel production,
  imports, refining, exports, prices, consumption, stocks, and reserves
* **Crude oil imports**:  aggregate national, Petroleum Administration for Defense
  Districts, state, city, port, and refinery petroleum imports data for various
  grades of crude oil and country of origin.
* **Coal**: aggregate national, state, and mine-level coal production statistics,
  including imports and exports, receipts of coal at electric power plants,
  consumption and quality, market sales, reserves, and productive capacity;
* **Densified biomass**: statistics of U.S. biomass production, capacity,
  inventories, feedstocks, costs, exports and other characteristics.
* **Nuclear plant generation outages**: daily facility, generator U.S. level outage
  reports with capacity, outages, and percent outage from the Nuclear Regulatory
  Commission.
* **Outlook of energy market/projections**: the Annual Energy Outlook, the
  International Energy Outlook and the Short Term Energy Outlook.
* **Total energy**: U.S. total energy production, prices, carbon dioxide emissions,
  and consumption of energy from all sources by sector.
* **State energy data system**: state and national energy production and consumption,
  using survey and estimates to create comprehensive state energy statistics and flows.
* **CO2 emissions**: CO2 emissions aggregates, CO2 emissions and carbon coefficients
  by fuel, state, and sector.
* **International energy**: International Energy System (IES) data containing
  production, reserves, consumption, capacity, storage, imports, exports, and emissions
  time series by country for electricity, petroleum, natural gas, coal, nuclear, and
  renewable energy.

Data available through PUDL
---------------------------


PUDL archives all the data available within the API through the EIA's bulk API download,
but only integrates one table of Electricity timeseries.



Who submits this data?
----------------------


Respondents within the API are wide ranging because the API pulls from many different
EIA forms. The electricity data is sourced from respondents of many of the EIA forms
that are processed in PUDL. See the other EIA data source pages for more details.



What does the original data look like?
--------------------------------------


EIA's bulk electricity data contains >750,00 JSON objects, most of which are timeseries.
These timeseries contain a number of variables (fuel amount and cost are just two)
across multiple levels of aggregation from individual plants to national averages.

The data is formatted as a single >1GB text file of line-delimited JSON with one line
per object. Each JSON structure has two nested levels: the top level contains metadata
describing the series and the second level (under the "data" heading) contains an array
of timestamp/value pairs.


Notable Irregularities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The state-level fuel data that PUDL uses is compiled from published and redacted
plant-level fuel deliveries. This fills in about 71% of all of the missing monthly
fuel cost records in :ref:`out_eia923__fuel_receipts_costs`. Another missing ~6% is
filled in using rolling averages, but 23% of the originally missing records aren't
able to be filled in with these two methods. Why?

It turns out that the original data is not missing at random and the EIA redacts enough
records to leave large gaps. In general IPPs (merchant generators) redact all their
fuel prices, and these generators are concentrated in competitive wholesale markets,
especially the Northeastern US, where there are essentially no reported fuel prices. In
addition, the Northeast has a unique seasonality in its natural gas prices, which would
be impossible to infer by sampling data elsewhere in the country. Finally, there are
major discontinuities in data collection and processing methodology. The most severe
(and most recent) was in 2013, when the temporal resolution changed from annual to
monthly. Prior to 2013, monthly resolution data was collected for a sample of plants
and the rest was calculated via a regression model. Also, the reporting threshold for
oil and gas fueled plants changed from 50MW to 200MW.

Some of the most granular data about electric power plants - most notably the
generator-level data - are not published in EIA's API. This is the main reason why PUDL
does not rely on the API data for all of its data from the various EIA forms.


PUDL Data Transformations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To see the transformations applied to the data in each table, you can read the
docstrings for :mod:`pudl.transform.eiaapi` created for each table's
respective transform function.

The EIA API's data structure leads to a natural normalization into two
tables - one of metadata and one of timeseries. That is the format delivered by PUDL's
extract module. PUDL's transform module parses a compound primary key out of long string
IDs ("series_id") which is published as :ref:`core_eia__yearly_fuel_receipts_costs_aggs`.
The rest of the metadata is not very valuable so is not transformed or returned.

The EIA aggregates are related to their component categories via a set of association
tables defined in pudl.metadata.dfs. For example, the "all_coal" fuel aggregate is
linked to all the coal-related energy_source_code values: BIT, SUB, LIG, and WC. Similar
relationships are defined for aggregates over fuel, sector, geography, and time.

Within other EIA tables, we use the monthly state-level fuel costs to fill the gaps in
missing fuel cost originating from the :ref:`core_eia923__monthly_fuel_receipts_costs`
table.
