Background
^^^^^^^^^^

NREL publishes `Annual Technology Baseline (ATB) <https://atb.nrel.gov>`__ data for the
`Electricity <https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity>`__ and
`Transportation <https://atb.nrel.gov/transportation>`__ sectors.

The NREL Annual Technology Baseline (ATB) provides a consistent set of technology cost
and performance data for energy analysis.

To inform electric and transportation sector analysis in the United States, each year
NREL provides a robust set of modeling input assumptions for energy technologies (the
Annual Technology Baseline).

The ATB is a populated framework to identify technology-specific cost and performance
parameters or other investment decision metrics across a range of fuel price conditions
as well as site-specific conditions for electric generation technologies at present and
with projections through 2050.

Data available through PUDL
---------------------------


PUDL incorporates all NREL ATB data from 2021 through 2024. NREL publishes ATB on
an annual basis since 2015, but only started publishing data about the
transportation sector in 2020.

NREL has been publishing ATB as parquet files since 2019 alongside the excel workbooks.
See issue :issue:`3576` for why we have not integrated the 2019 and 2020 parquet files.




Who submits this data?
----------------------


NREL ATB does not have respondents like utilities or plant operators submitting data the
way that many other PUDL data sources do. NREL ATB is entirely developed by analysts at
NREL as most of the data in ATB is projections about the future. NREL provides extensive
documentation about how they've developed the ATB projections.




What does the original data look like?
--------------------------------------



NREL has been publishing ATB in several formats: excel workbooks, CSV files, Tableau
workbooks as well and parquet files. PUDL processes and republishes the parquet files,
but if you'd like to explore any of the other formats they are easy to access on the
`ATB site <https://atb.nrel.gov>`__. You can also access all of the formats on our
`Zenodo archive of raw NREL ATB data <https://zenodo.org/records/15772175>`__.

The workbooks are formatted well for exploring the data manually. The CSV and parquet
data is reported in a very skinny format that enables the raw data to have the same
schema over time. A column in the original data named ``core_metric_parameter``
contains a string which indicates what type of data is being reported in the ``value``
column. PUDL reformats this skinny table into four wider tables.

NREL also publishes extensive `documentation <https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/about>`__.
If there are any questions about their methodology or terms or variables, their
documentation is a great place to start.



Notable Irregularities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* In the skinny parquet and CSV version of NREL ATB, the column ``core_metric_parameter``
  contains a string which indicates what type of data is being reported in the original
  ``value`` column. In PUDL, the skinny ATB data is transposed and normalized into
  multiple wider tidy tables, wherein most of the column names correspond to the strings
  in the original ``core_metric_parameter`` column.
* The convention for ATB data is to use an asterisk in the key columns as a wildcard
  in the parquet files. In processing the ATB data for PUDL, we remove these wildcard
  asterisks from the PUDL primary key columns by replacing these asterisks with all
  values available.



PUDL Data Transformations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To see the transformations applied to the data in each table, you can read the
docstrings for :mod:`pudl.transform.nrelatb` created for each table's
respective transform function.
