Background
^^^^^^^^^^

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Utilities Service (RUS)
`Form 12 <https://www.rd.usda.gov/resources/forms/rus-forms>`__, now known as
the **Financial and Operating Report - Power Supply**, collects detailed annual financial
and operational data about rural electric distribution utilities. The form was created to
provide financial oversight to loan officers lending money to rural cooperatives. RUS
does not publish the responses to these forms it collects - this data was obtained by
submitting annual FOIA requests. The resulting data provides financial and operational
insight into utilities that are otherwise excluded from the FERC Form 1 filings due to
their limited service territory, lack of wholesale power sales subject to federal
jurisdiction, and classification as non-public utilities.

What data is available through PUDL?
------------------------------------


We've integrated all RUS 12 tables with the exception of eight totals
tables containing aggregated versions of values present in other tables.




Who is required to fill out the form?
-------------------------------------


RUS-12 is completed by rural electric cooperatives that generate or purchase power for
distribution and receive loans or financial support from the USDA Rural Utilities
Service (RUS) program.



What does the original data look like?
--------------------------------------


The raw data are accessed via FOIA request and are formatted as a collection of
annualized CSVs. Each file in the collection corresponds to a different part of
the original form.
