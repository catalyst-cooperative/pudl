Background
^^^^^^^^^^

EIA `Form 176 <https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/TblDefs/NG_DataSources.html#s176>`__, also
known as the **Annual Report of Natural and Supplemental Gas Supply and Disposition**,
describes the origins, suppliers, and disposition of natural gas on a yearly and state
by state basis.

As of 2025, the EIA-176 Form is organized into the following parts:

* **Part 1:** Identification
* **Part 3:** Company characteristics
* **Part 4:** Natural and supplemental gas supply
* **Part 5:** Liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage inventory
* **Part 6:** Natural and supplemental gas disposition
* **Part 7:** Comments, footnotes and continuation text lines

What data is available through PUDL?
------------------------------------


We are actively integrating EIA-176 data into PUDL with support from external contributors.
Currently, Part 6 of the form is the only one that has been fully integrated.




Who is required to fill out the form?
-------------------------------------


According to the EIA, the Form EIA‐176 must be completed by:

* Interstate natural gas pipeline companies
* Intrastate natural gas pipeline companies
* Natural gas distribution companies
* Underground natural gas storage operators
* Synthetic natural gas plant operators
* Field, well, or processing plant operators that deliver natural gas directly to
  consumers (including their own industrial facilities) other than for lease or
  plant use or processing.
* Field, well, or processing plant operators that transport gas to, across, or from a
  state border through field or gathering facilities
* Liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage operators, both peaking facilities and marine
  terminals
* Producers of high‐Btu renewable natural gas that inject into an interstate or
  intra‐state pipeline, or who deliver to a natural gas distributor.

Data is collected annually from approximately 2,000 respondents, with a March 1st
filing deadline. Each operator must file **one report per state** in which they are doing
any of the following activities:

* Gas (natural, commingled natural and supplemental gas, or LNG) transportation using
  respondent‐operated facilities other than field or gathering lines
* Gas transportation to, from, or across a state border using respondent‐operated field
  or gathering lines
* Gas delivery directly to consumers using respondent‐operated facilities other than
  field, well, or plant operators delivering solely for lease and plant use or processing
* Gas storage in respondent‐operated underground storage reservoirs, or LNG storage
  facilities
* Synthetic natural gas production in respondent‐operated facilities

Subsidiary companies are required to file separate reports if they meet these filing
requirements, but can specifically request permission from the EIA to consolidate
filing.




What does the original data look like?
--------------------------------------


We archive EIA-176 data from two sources: CSV files that are exported from the `EIA
Natural Gas Query System <https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/ngqs>`__ by iterating through
all predefined reports related to Form 176, as well as a custom report that includes
every numerical series related to Form 176. We also archive but do not currently process
the bulk CSV download of all available natural gas data, since it is less well
structured than the exports from the Natural Gas Query System.



Notable Irregularities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Offshore gas reporting:** For the purposes of Form 176 filings, a state is defined
  as including adjacent offshore Federal Domain areas. This means that any offshore gas
  operations will be reported under the relevant state.
* **Adjustment companies:** The original company-level data contains a number of "adjustment companies"
  that do not appear to be documented in the Natural Gas Query System `user guide <https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/ngqs/ngqs_user_guide.pdf>`__.
  These companies all have "adjustment company" in their name and IDs beginning with 176999.
  These records are included in the company-level data where they report values.


PUDL Data Transformations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To see the transformations applied to the data in each table, you can read the
docstrings for :mod:`pudl.transform.eia176` created for each table's
respective transform function.

Validating and dropping duplicated data
---------------------------------------
The original data includes aggregated data at the U.S. and state-wide scale, which we
validate against the company-level data but do not publish to avoid data duplication.

Similarly, the original data includes totals fields (e.g., sales totals) that are sums
of other fields and are calculated by the EIA, not directly reported by companies filling
out the form. We validate these totals fields against their components and drop them
during transformation to avoid duplicating values during aggregation.
