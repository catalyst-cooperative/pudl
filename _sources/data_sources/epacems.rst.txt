PUDL Database Tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clicking on the links will show you a description of the table as well as the names and
descriptions of each of its fields. Due to the size of the CEMS data we do not publish
it as part of our SQLite database, but it is available through all of our other
:doc:`data access methods <../data_access>`.

Background
^^^^^^^^^^

`Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems
<https://www.epa.gov/emc/emc-continuous-emission-monitoring-systems>`__ (CEMS) are used
to determine the rate of gas or particulate matter exiting a point source of emissions.
The EPA `Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) <https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets>`__
has collected data on power plant emissions from CEMS units stretching back to 1995. The
CEMS dataset includes hourly gross load, SO2, CO2, and NOx emissions associated with
a given point source, usually a boiler. However the connection between EPA emissions
units and EIA boilers isn't perfect. See "Notable Irregularities" below.

Data available through PUDL
---------------------------


We integrate all years of EPA CEMS hourly data, including all reporting states.

EPA releases the hourly CEMS data on a quarterly basis, with a lag of 2-3 months. We
update the CEMS data within PUDL on a quarterly schedule.



Who is required to install CEMS and report to EPA?
--------------------------------------------------


`Part 75 <https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=d20546b42dd4ea978d0de7eabe15cbf4&mc=true&n=pt40.18.75&r=PART&ty=HTML#se40.18.75_12>`__
of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the backbone of the Clean Air Act's Acid Rain
Program, requires fossil-combustion units to install and use CEMS. The qualifications
(§75.2(a), §72.6(a)) are closely followed by a myriad of exceptions (§75.2(b), §72.6(b),
§72.7, §72.8). Among the many extenuating circumstances depicted are exemptions for
retired units; old, simple conbustion turbine units; non-utility untis; units supplying
generators with 25MW or less in capacity; units that have never sold their electricity;
and units burning low-sulfer fuels.

Once CEMS are installed, Part 75 requires hourly data recording, including during
startup, shutdown, and instances of malfunction as well as quarterly data reporting to
the EPA. The regulation further details the protocol for missing data calculations and
backup monitoring for instances of CEMS failure (see §§75.31-37).

A plain English explanation of the requirements of Part 75 is available in section
`2.0 Overview of Part 75 Monitoring Requirements <https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/plain_english_guide_to_the_part_75_rule.pdf>`__



What does the original data look like?
--------------------------------------


EPA CAMD publishes the CEMS data in an online `data portal <https://campd.epa.gov/>`__.
The files are available in a prepackaged format, accessible via a `user interface
<https://campd.epa.gov/data/custom-data-download>`__, and also through the
`EPA Clean Air Markets API <https://www.epa.gov/power-sector/cam-api-portal>`__ (which
we use to produce archives of the data).


Notable Irregularities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


CEMS is BIG
-----------
CEMS is the largest dataset in PUDL, with hourly records for thousands of plants
spanning decades. To make this large table more usable, we distribute the CEMS data
using the `Apache Parquet <https://parquet.apache.org/>`__ file format rather than
SQLite.

Check out the `PUDL data access example notebook on Kaggle
<https://www.kaggle.com/code/catalystcooperative/01-pudl-data-access>`__ or in our
`pudl-examples repository <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl-examples>`__ on
GitHub for pointers on how to access this dataset efficiently using :mod:`polars`.

EPA units vs. EIA units
-----------------------
Another important thing to note is the difference between EPA "units" and EIA "units".
Power plants are complex entities that have multiple subcomponents. In fossil powered
plants, emissions come from the combustion of fuel. This occurs in the boiler for coal
plants or the gas turbine for gas plants. When the EPA uses the term "unit" it is
referring to the emissions unit or smokestack where the CEMS equipment are (i.e., the
boiler or gas turbine). When the EIA refers to a "unit" it's usually referring to the
electricity generating unit (i.e. the generator). Some plants have a one-to-one
relationship between boilers and generators or gas turbines and generators, but many do
not.

The EPA and EIA have addressed this discrepancy by creating a `crosswalk
<https://github.com/USEPA/camd-eia-crosswalk>`__ between the
various sub-plant groupings reported to them. The ``plant_id_eia`` values from the
crosswalk are integrated into the EPA CEMS Parquet files available in PUDL.

Take a look at this helpful depiction of plant types from the EPA's crosswalk repo.

docstrings for :mod:`pudl.transform.epacems` created for each table's
respective transform function.
