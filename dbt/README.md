# Overview

This directory contains an initial setup of a `dbt` project meant to write [data
tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests) for PUDL data. The project is
setup with profiles that allow you to select running tests on `nightly` builds,
`etl-full`, or `etl-fast` outputs. The `nightly` profile will operate directly on
parquet files in our S3 bucket, while both the `etl-full` and `etl-fast` profiles will
look for parquet files based on your `PUDL_OUTPUT` environment variable. See the `Usage`
section below for examples using these profiles.

# Development

To setup the `dbt` project, simply install the PUDL `conda` environment as normal,
then run the following commands from this directory.

```
dbt deps
dbt seed
```

## Adding new tables

### Helper script

To add a new table to the project, you must add it as a [dbt
source](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources). We've included a helper script to
automate the process at `devtools/dbt_helper.py`.

### Usage

#### `add-tables`

The first command provided by the helper script is `add-tables`. This has already been
run for all existing tables, but may be useful when we add new tables to PUDL.

```
python devtools/dbt_helper.py add-tables {table_name(s)}
```

This will add a file called `dbt/models/{data_source}/{table_name}/schema.yml` for each
table. This yaml file tells `dbt` about the table and it's schema. It will also apply
the test `check_row_counts_per_partition`. This test works by storing row counts per
year (or all row counts for time independent tables) in the csv files called
`etl_fast_row_counts.csv` and `etl_full_row_counts.csv` and checking these row counts
against the actual table.

To see all options for this command run:

```
python devtools/dbt_helper.py add-tables --help
```

#### `migrate-tests`

The second command in the helper script is called `migrate-tests`. This command is used
to migrate existing `vs_bounds` tests. There are many of these tests in our existing
validation framework, and the configuration is relatively verbose, so this script should
be very useful for migrating these tests quickly.

The basic usage of this command looks like:

```
python devtools/dbt_helper.py migrate-tests \
    --test-config-name {config_variable}
    --table-name {table_name}
```

Where `config_variable` points to a variable defined in `src/pudl/validate.py`, which
contains a list of configuration `dict`s for the `vs_bounds` tests, and `table_name`
refers to the table the test should be applied to. See below for an example of using
this command.

## Adding tests

### Default case

Once a table is included as a `source`, you can add tests for the table. You can either
add a generic test directly in `src/pudl/dbt/models/{table_name}/schema.yml`, or create
a `sql` file in the directory `src/pudl/dbt/tests/`, which references the `source`. When
adding `sql` tests like this, you should construct a query that `SELECT`'s rows that
indicate a failure. That is, if the query returns any rows, `dbt` will raise a failure
for that test.

The project includes [dbt-expectations](https://github.com/metaplane/dbt-expectations)
and [dbt-utils](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils) as dependencies. These packages
include useful tests out of the box that can be applied to any tables in the project.
There are several examples in
`src/pudl/dbt/models/out_vcerare__hourly_available_capacity_factor/schema.yml` which use
`dbt-expectations`.

### Modifying a table before test

In some cases you may want to modify the table before applying tests. There are two ways
to accomplish this. First, you can add the table as a `source` as described above, then
create a SQL file in the `tests/` directory like `tests/{data_source}/{table_name}.yml`.
From here you can construct a SQL query to modify the table and execute a test on the
intermediate table you've created. `dbt` expects a SQL test to be a query that returns 0
rows for a successful test. See the `dbt` [source
function](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/source) for guidance on
how to reference a `source` from a SQL file.

The second method is to create a [model](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/models)
which will produce the intermediate table you want to execute tests on. To use this
approach, simply add a sql file to `dbt/models/{data_source}/{table_name}/`. Now, add a
SQL file to this directory named `validate_{table_name}` and define your model for
producing the intermediate table here. Finally, add the model to the `schema.yml` file
and define tests exactly as you would for a `source` table. See
`models/ferc1/out_ferc1__yearly_steam_plants_fuel_by_plant_sched402` for an example of
this pattern.

Note: when adding a model, it will be stored as a SQL `view` in the file
`{PUDL_OUTPUT}/pudl_dbt_tests.duckdb`.

## Running tests

There are a few ways to execute tests. To run all tests with a single command:

```
dbt build
```

This command will first run any models, then execute all tests.

For more finegrained control, you can use the `--select` option to only run tests
on a specific table.

To run all tests for a single source table:

```
dbt build --select source:pudl.{table_name}
```

To run all tests on a table that uses an intermediate `dbt model`, you can do:

```
dbt build --select {model_name}
```

### Selecting target profile

To select between `nightly`, `etl-full`, and `etl-fast` profiles, append `--target
{target_name}` to any of the previous commands.

## Updating a table

### Modify `schema.yml`

Once we have generated an initial `schema.yml` file, we expect this configuration to be
maintained/updated manually in the future. For example, we can add
[data-tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests) as described in the `dbt`
docs, or add/remove columns if the table schema is changed.

In the future we might migrate much of our schema/constraint testing into `dbt` as well.
In this case the easiest approach would be to update the `dbt_helper.py` script to
generate the necessary configuration from our existing metadata structures. In this
case, we should be careful to make the script not overwrite any manual configuration
changes that we make between now and then.

### Update row counts

When we run the `add-tables` command, it generates a test for each table called
`check_row_counts_per_partition`. This test uses row counts that are stored in csv files
called `etl_fast_row_counts.csv` and `etl_full_row_counts.csv` and compares these counts
to the row counts found in the actual table when the test is run. The test partitions
row counts by year, so there are a number of rows in these csv files for each table
(unless the table has no time dimension).

During development row counts often change for normal and expected reasons like adding
new data, updating transformations, etc. When these changes happen, the tests will fail
unless we update the row counts stored in the csv files mentioned above. To see where
these tests failed, you can run:

```
dbt build --select source:pudl.{table_name} --store-failures --target={etl-fast|etl-full}
```

The output of this command should show you a `sql` query you can use to see partitions
where the row count test failed. To see these, you can do:

```
duckdb {PUDL_OUTPUT}/pudl_dbt_tests.duckdb
```

Then copy and paste the query into the duckdb CLI (you'll need to add a semicolon to the
end). This should show you the years and the expected and found row counts. If the
changes seem reasonable and expected, you can manually update these files, or you can
run the command:

```
python devtools/dbt_helper.py add-tables {table_name} --row-counts-only --clobber --use-local-tables
```

This will tell the helper script to overwrite the existing row counts with new row
counts from the table in your local `PUDL_OUTPUT` stash. If you want to update the
`etl-fast` row counts, simply append the option `--etl-fast` to the above command.

### Test migration example

This section will walk through migrating an existing collection of validation tests. As
an example, we'll use the tests in `test/validate/mcoe_test.py`. This file contains a
collection of tests which use some common methods defined in `pudl/validate.py`. These
tests are representative of many of the types of tests we're looking to migrate.

### `vs_bounds` tests

We'll start with a set of tests which use the `vs_bounds` method defined in
`validate.py`. These check that a specified quantile of a numeric column is within a
configurable set of bounds. The values to configure the quantiles and the bounds are
defined in config `dict`'s, in `validate.py`. For example, the test,
`test_gas_capacity_factor`, references configuration stored in the variable
`mcoe_gas_capacity_factor`. Once we know where the configuration is stored, we need to
identify the specific tables used in the test. This test is producing tables with the
`PudlTabl` method `mcoe_generators`. This method returns the tables
`out_eia__monthly_generators`, and `out_eia__yearly_generators`. To migrate these tests
we'll first want generate `dbt` configuration for these tables.

```
python devtools/dbt_helper.py add-tables out_eia__monthly_generators out_eia__yearly_generators
```

This will create the files `dbt/models/output/out_eia__{AGG}_generators/schema.yml`,
which will tell `dbt` about the table and generate row count tests. Note the exact
format of this file might be modified by our linting tools, but this does not change
functionality.

Next, we want to update the `dbt` configuration to add tests equivalent to the
`vs_bounds` tests. The `dbt_helper` script contains a command that can automatically
generate this `dbt` configuration from the exisitng python config. To do this you can
use a command like:

```
python devtools/dbt_helper.py migrate-tests \
    --table-name out_eia__AGG_generators \
    --test-config-name mcoe_gas_capacity_factor
```

This command will add the necessary tests. There is a chance that formatting could get
messed up slightly in the translation, but will work out of the box in the general case.

To see the tests generated by these commands, look to the `schema.yml` files mentioned
above. You can also execute these tests with the following command.

```
dbt test --select source:pudl.out_eia__AGG_generators
```

When we run these tests, if there were errors in the
`expect_column_weighted_quantile_values_to_be_between` due to changes in the
distribution of the underlying data, or because they SQL based calculation isn't exactly
the same as the Python based calculation, in say, this example test:

```
- expect_column_weighted_quantile_values_to_be_between:
  quantile: 0.65
  max_value: 0.7
  row_condition: fuel_type_code_pudl='gas' and report_date>=CAST('2015-01-01' AS DATE) and capacity_factor<>0.0
  weight_column: capacity_mw
```

You debug it using `duckdb`. There are many ways to interact with
`duckdb`, here will use the CLI. See the [here](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/)
for installation directions. To launch the CLI, navigate to the directory that your
`PUDL_OUTPUT` environment variable points to, and execute:

```
duckdb pudl_dbt_tests.duckdb
```

Now we want to execute portions of the compiled SQL produced by `dbt`. To find this,
look at the output of the test failure, and you should see a line under the test failure
that looks like `compiled code at {path_to_sql}`. Looking at this file, we'll pull out
the section

```sql
WITH CumulativeWeights AS (
    SELECT
        capacity_factor,
        capacity_mw,
        SUM(capacity_mw) OVER (ORDER BY capacity_factor) AS cumulative_weight,
        SUM(capacity_mw) OVER () AS total_weight
    FROM 'https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/out_eia__yearly_generators.parquet'
    WHERE capacity_factor IS NOT NULL OR capacity_mw IS NOT NULL
),
QuantileData AS (
    SELECT
        capacity_factor,
        capacity_mw,
        cumulative_weight,
        total_weight,
        cumulative_weight / total_weight AS cumulative_probability
    FROM CumulativeWeights
)
SELECT capacity_factor
FROM QuantileData
WHERE cumulative_probability >= 0.65
ORDER BY capacity_factor
LIMIT 1
```

This is where the weighted quantile is actually calculated. We can copy this into the
`duckdb` CLI, add a semicolon to the end of the last line and hit `Enter`. This produces
the output:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ capacity_factor │
│      float      │
├─────────────────┤
│   0.82587963    │
└─────────────────┘
```

This is failing because the `max_value` is set to `0.7`. If we change this value to
0.83, this test should now pass.

### `no_null_cols` tests

The method `test_no_null_cols_mcoe` in `mcoe_test.py` checks a number of tables to
validate that there are no completely null columns. We've added a custom test to the
`dbt` project that can accomplish this. To use this test, simply apply the
`not_all_null` test to a column in question:

```
    columns:
    - name: report_date
      data_tests:
      - not_all_null
```

See `dbt/models/_out_eia__monthly_heat_rate_by_unit/schema.yml` for specific examples.

Note: there is also a builtin test in `dbt` called `not_null` that will make sure
there are no null values at all in a column.

### `no_null_rows` tests

The method `test_no_null_rows_mcoe` in `mcoe_test.py` checks a number of tables to
validate that there are no completely null rows. We've added a custom test
to the `dbt` project that can accomplish this. To use this test, simply apply the
`no_null_rows` test to a table:

```
version: 2
sources:
  - name: pudl
    tables:
      - name: _out_eia__monthly_derived_generator_attributes
        data_tests:
          - no_null_rows
```

See `dbt/models/_out_eia__monthly_derived_generator_attributes/schema.yml` for
a specific example.

### `bespoke` tests

As the name implies, `bespoke` tests will require some degree of custom handling.
That being said, there are common patterns for how/where to add these tests. Some
tests can also potentially make use of builtin tests provided by `dbt_expectations`,
`dbt_utils`, and `dbt` itself.

For an example, we'll demonstrate migrating the test `test_idle_capacity`. This
test is applied to the `out_eia__{freq}_generators` tables. Because this test is applied
to two different tables, we'll define it as a
[generic data test](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests#generic-data-tests).
This allows us to reuse a single test on both tables. If this test was only used
on a single table, we could create a
[singular data test](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests#singular-data-tests).

To create a new generic test, we will add a new file called `dbt/macros/test_idle_capacity.sql`.
Then, we develop a SQL query to mimic the behavior of the original test. For details
see the SQL file. It uses `jinja` fairly extensively to set/access bounds. Once this
new test has been developed, we can apply it to the tables by modifying their `schema.yml`
as so:

```
version: 2
sources:
  - name: pudl
    tables:
      - name: out_eia__yearly_generators
        data_tests:
          - test_idle_capacity
```
