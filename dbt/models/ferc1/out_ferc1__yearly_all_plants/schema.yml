              description: >
                Exactly which years have rolling averages will depend on what years
                of data have been processed, since the moving window will exclude the
                first couple of years in the range. This means we can't define a simple
                range of years in which we expect them to be non-null. The
                capex_annual_addition column is calculated by taking the difference
                between adjacent capex_total values, so it will always be null in the
                first year of data... at least in the case of the DBF data -- the XBRL
                data (2021 and later) includes both the current and previous year's
                values, so even if we only process a single recent year of data, we will
                still end up with a non-null value. The capex_annual_per_* columns are
                all derived from the capex_annual_addition column, so they have the same
                pattern of null values.
