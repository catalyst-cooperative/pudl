                    Check that every capacity factor aggregation key appears in the
                    aggregations. This isn't a normal foreign-key relationship, since
                    the aggregation group isn't the primary key in the aggregation
                    tables, and is not unique in either of these tables, but if an
                    aggregation group appears in the capacity factor time series and
                    never appears in the aggregation table, then something is wrong.
