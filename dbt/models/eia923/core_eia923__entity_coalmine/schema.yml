                Because this is an entity table, it only describes attributes that are
                constant across time. However, the county FIPS code is only available in
                some reporting years. If one of those years is processed, then it is
                non-null in this table. If none of those years are processed, then it
                will be entirely null here, and there is no column that we can
                aggregate across to identify when it should be null or non-null, so it
                is excluded from the test.
