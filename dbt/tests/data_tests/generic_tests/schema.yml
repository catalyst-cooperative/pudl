  - name: test_expect_column_fraction_with_condition
    description: >
      Check whether the fraction of a column's total sum that meet a specified condition
      falls within acceptable bounds. Calculates the sum of column values where the
      condition is true, divided by the total sum of the column, and verifies this
      fraction is between min_fraction and max_fraction. Useful for validating data
      quality metrics like "what fraction of total capacity comes from renewable
      sources."
    arguments:
      - name: column_name
        type: string
        description: The name of the column whose values will be summed and checked.
      - name: numerator_row_condition
        type: string
        description: >
          SQL condition that determines which rows to include in the sum in the
          numerator of the calculated fraction (e.g., "fuel_type_code_pudl='solar'").
      - name: min_fraction
        type: float
        description: Minimum acceptable fraction (between 0 and 1).
      - name: max_fraction
        type: float
        description: Maximum acceptable fraction (between 0 and 1).

  - name: test_expect_includes_all_value_combinations_from
    description: >
      Check that all values in a column or set of columns are the same as the same set
      of columns in another table. Similar to a foreign key constraint, but rather than
      check if values from the model table exist in a comparison table, this checks if
      the comparison table has values that don't exist in the model table. Note that
      this check is only one way. If you also want to check whether the model table has
      values that don't exist in the comparison table, you'll need to call this function
      in the schema of the comparison table as well.
    arguments:
      - name: compare_table_name
        type: string
        description: The name of the table to compare columns with
      - name: compare_cols
        type: list
        description: >
          A list of column names present in both tables. The test will succeed only if
          all combinations of column values present in at least one row in the
          comparison table are present in this table.

  - name: test_expect_columns_not_all_null
    description: >
      Check that all columns in a table are not entirely NULL. Can exclude specific
      columns and apply conditional checks (e.g., only check for NULLs when certain
      conditions are met). Uses DuckDB's DESCRIBE to dynamically discover column names.
      When ignore_eia860m_nulls is enabled, automatically excludes years which are
      only available in EIA-860M.
    arguments:
      - name: exclude_columns
        type: list
        description: List of column names to exclude from the null check (optional, default empty list).
      - name: row_conditions
        type: dict
        description: >
          Dictionary mapping column names to SQL row conditions. For each column, the null
          check will only be applied to rows matching the condition (optional, default
          empty dict).
      - name: ignore_eia860m_nulls
        type: boolean
        description: >
          When true, excludes years after the last available EIA-860 annual data
          (dynamically determined from core_eia860__scd_ownership.report_date) from null
          checks for all columns. This deals with the limitation that EIA-860M only
          reports a subset of values which appear in the full EIA-860, which results in
          many entirely null columns in EIA-860M-only years. NOTE: Setting this
          parameter to true requires that the table being tested contains a
          'report_date' column for year filtering.

  - name: test_expect_complete_valid_ownership
    description: >
      Check whether ``fraction_owned`` columns sum too high (for any individual
      generator) or too low (for too many generators). Designed for use on
      ``out_eia860__yearly_ownership``. Fails when any generator has
      sum(fraction_owned) more than 1.02, or when more than half of generators have
      sum(fraction_owned) less than 0.98.
    arguments:
      - name: n_acceptable_failures
        type: integer

  - name: test_expect_consistent_years
    description: >
      Check whether two temporal columns in a model have consistent years for the vast
      majority of records. Designed for tables with both a high-frequency datetime
      column (hourly or more frequent) and a separate date/year column that describes
      the reporting period. Due to timezone adjustments, a small fraction of records may
      have different years between these columns. Fails when the mismatch ratio exceeds
      the specified threshold.
    arguments:
      - name: datetime_column
        type: string
        description: High-frequency datetime column (e.g., 'datetime_utc').

        type: integer
        description: The number of generators allowed to have inconsistent spellings.

  - name: test_expect_date_frequency_ratio
    description: >
      Check whether two models have the expected ratio of distinct dates for overlapping years.
      Commonly used to verify that monthly and annual data have the correct 12:1 relationship,
      but works for any frequency ratio. Excludes provisional data (incremental_ytd, monthly_update)
      when data_maturity columns are present. Fails when the ratio of distinct dates doesn't match
      the expected multiplier for years present in both models.
    arguments:
      - name: compare_model
        type: string
        description: The reference model to compare against (typically lower frequency, e.g. annual).

        type: boolean
        description: "Tell the test that the data_maturity column exists in the model (default: true). If this column is available, it will be used to filter out incomplete years of data."

  - name: test_expect_fgd_cost_totals_to_agree
    description: >
      Check whether the sum of itemized costs matches the total cost. Designed for use
      on ``_core_eia860__fgd_equipment``. Fails when more than 1% of rows have a sum
      that differs from the total by more than 1%. Includes careful null and nan
      handling.

  - name: test_expect_matching_primary_fuel_by_cost_and_mmbtu
    description: >
      Check whether the primary fuel by cost matches the primary fuel by mmbtu. Designed
      for use on ``out_ferc1__yearly_steam_plants_fuel_by_plant_sched402``. Fails when
      more than 5% of rows have different cost vs mmbtu primary fuels.

  - name: test_expect_one2one_mapping
    description: >
      Check whether there is a 1:1 mapping between two columns by grouping by the first

  - name: test_expect_unique_utility_id_eia
    description: >
      Check whether each generator has exactly one operator utility on any particular
      date. Designed for use on ``out_eia860__yearly_ownership``. Fails when any
      (``report_date``, ``plant_id_eia``, ``generator_id``) combination has more than
      one unique value for ``operator_utility_id_eia``.
    arguments:
      - name: n_acceptable_failures
        type: integer
        description: The number of generators allowed to multiple operator utilities on any particular date; default 0.

  - name: test_expect_valid_hour_of_year
    description: >
      Check whether ``hour_of_year`` is consistent with ``datetime_utc``. Designed for
      use on ``out_vcerare__hourly_available_capacity_factor``. Fails when the hour
      computed from the datetime does not match.

  - name: test_expect_valid_plantparts_ownership_fraction

      Check whether ``fraction_owned`` columns sum too high (for any individual plant
      part) or too low (for too many plant parts). Designed for use on
      ``out_eia__yearly_plant_parts``. Fails when any owned plant part with nonzero
      capacity has sum(fraction_owned) more than 1e-6 away from 1, or when more than

    description: >
      Check whether the sum of the specified columns matches a designated total column.
      Fails when the fraction of records with more than ``discrepancy_threshold``
      difference to the value of the total column (as a fraction of the value of the
      total column) exceeds ``max_discrepancy_rate``. Records with null in total column
      do not count as discrepancies. Nulls in sum columns are coerced to 0.
    arguments:
      - name: sum_columns
        type: list[str]
        description: The columns whose sum should match the value in the total column.

  - name: test_expect_columns_are_close
    description: >
      Check that two float columns are close using the same criteria as
      ``numpy.isclose``. Generally this is used with the ``row_condition`` argument, as
      it's uncommon that there are two columns which are supposed to be entirely equal,
      but there may be a subset of rows which are supposed to be equal.

    description: >
      Check that units are mostly only associated with a single fuel
      when mapped through the boiler generator association
      table. Fails when the incidence of units with multiple fuels
      exceeds a maximum rate.
    arguments:

        type: dbt source reference
        description: >
          Where to look for boiler generator associations. This will
