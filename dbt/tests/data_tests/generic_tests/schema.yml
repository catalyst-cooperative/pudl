  - name: test_check_column_correlation
    description: Check the correlation between two columns
    arguments:
      - name: column1
        type: string
        description: The name of the first column
      - name: column2
        type: string
        description: The name of the second column
      - name: correlation_coef
        type: float
        description: The minimum correlation coefficient we expect between the two columns.
  - name: test_check_row_counts_per_partition
    description: Check that the number of rows in each partition is as expected
    arguments:
      - name: table_name
        type: string
        description: The name of the table to check
      - name: partition_column
        type: string
        description: The name of the column to partition by
  - name: test_expect_includes_all_value_combinations_from
    description:
      Check that all values in a column or set of columns are the same
      as the same set of columns in another table. Similar to a foreign key
      constraint, but rather than check if values from the model table exist in a comparison table,
      this checks if the comparison table has values that don't exist in the model table. Note that
      this check is only one way. If you also want to check whether the model table has values that
      don't exist in the comparison table, you'll need to call this function in the schema of the
      comparison table as well.
    arguments:
      - name: compare_table_name
        type: string
        description: The name of the table to compare columns with
      - name: compare_cols
        type: list
        description: A list of column names present in both tables. The test will succeed only if all combinations of column values present in at least one row in the comparison table are present in this table.
  - name: test_no_null_rows
    description: Check that there are no null rows in the table
  - name: test_not_all_null
    description: Check that not all values in a column are null
