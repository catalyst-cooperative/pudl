  - name: compare_all_same_col_values
    description:
      Check that all values in a column or set of columns are the same
      as the same set of columns in another table. Similar to a foreign key
      constraint, but rather than check if values from the model table exist in a comparison table,
      this checks if the comparison table has values that don't exist in the model table.
    arguments:

        type: string
        description: The name of the table to compare columns with
      - name: compare_cols
        type: list
        description: A list of the column names to compare accross tables. This
          list will act as a composite key.
  - name: expect_column_quantile_values_to_be_between

      - name: weight_column
        type: string
        description: The name of the column to use as weights
      - name: min_value
