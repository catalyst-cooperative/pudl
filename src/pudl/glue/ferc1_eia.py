"""Extract and transform glue tables between FERC Form 1 and EIA 860/923.

FERC1 and EIA report on many of the same plants and utilities, but have no
embedded connection. We have combed through the FERC and EIA plants and
utilities to generate id's which can connect these datasets. The resulting
fields in the PUDL tables are `plant_id_pudl` and `utility_id_pudl`,
respectively. This was done by hand in a spreadsheet which is in the
`package_data/glue` directory. When mapping plants, we considered a plant a
co-located collection of electricity generation equipment. If a coal plant was
converted to a natural gas unit, our aim was to consider this the same plant.
This module simply reads in the mapping spreadsheet and converts it to a
dictionary of dataframes.

Because these mappings were done by hand and for every one of FERC Form 1's
thousands of reported plants, we know there are probably some incorrect or
incomplete mappings. If you see a `plant_id_pudl` or `utility_id_pudl` mapping
that you think is incorrect, please open an issue on our Github!

Note that the PUDL IDs may change over time. They are not guaranteed to be
stable. If you need to find a particular plant or utility reliably, you should
use its plant_id_eia, utility_id_eia, or utility_id_ferc1.

Another note about these id's: these id's map our definition of plants, which
is not the most granular level of plant unit. The generators are typically the
smaller, more interesting unit. FERC does not typically report in units
(although it sometimes does), but it does often break up gas units from coal
units. EIA reports on the generator and boiler level. When trying to use these
PUDL id's, consider the granularity that you desire and the potential
implications of using a co-located set of plant infrastructure as an id.

    That data is primarily stored in the plant_output and

    repository. There are a total of seven relations described in this data:

        - utilities: Unique id and name for each utility for use across the
          PUDL DB.
        - plants: Unique id and name for each plant for use across the PUDL DB.
        - utilities_eia: EIA operator ids and names attached to a PUDL
          utility id.
        - plants_eia: EIA plant ids and names attached to a PUDL plant id.
        - utilities_ferc: FERC respondent ids & names attached to a PUDL
          utility id.
        - plants_ferc: A combination of FERC plant names and respondent ids,
          associated with a PUDL plant ID. This is necessary because FERC does
          not provide plant ids, so the unique plant identifier is a
          combination of the respondent id and plant name.
        - utility_plant_assn: An association table which describes which plants
          have relationships with what utilities. If a record exists in this
          table then combination of PUDL utility id & PUDL plant id does have
          an association of some kind. The nature of that association is
          somewhat fluid, and more scrutiny will likely be required for use in
          analysis.

    Presently, the 'glue' tables are a very basic piece of infrastructure for
    the PUDL DB, because they contain the primary key fields for utilities and
    plants in FERC1.
