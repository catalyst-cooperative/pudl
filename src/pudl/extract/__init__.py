"""Modules implementing the "Extract" step of the PUDL ETL pipeline.

Each module in this subpackage implements data extraction for a single data
source from the PUDL :ref:`data-sources`. This process begins with
the original data as retrieved by the :mod:`pudl.workspace` subpackage, and
ends with a dictionary of "raw" :class:`pandas.DataFrame`s, that have been
minimally altered from the original data, and are ready for normalization and
data cleaning by the data source specific modules in the :mod:`pudl.transform`
subpackage.
