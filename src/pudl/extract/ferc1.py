"""Tools for extracting data from the FERC Form 1 FoxPro database for use in PUDL.

FERC distributes the annual responses to Form 1 as binary FoxPro database
files. This format is no longer widely supported, and so our first challenge in
accessing the Form 1 data is to convert it into a modern format. In addition,
FERC distributes one database for each year, and these databases are not
explicitly linked together. Over time the structure has changed as new tables
and fields have been added. In order to be able to use the data to do analyses
across many years, we need to bring all of it into a unified structure. However
it appears that these changes are only entirely additive -- the most recent
versions of the DB contain all the tables and fields that existed in earlier
versions.

PUDL uses the most recently released year of data as a template, and infers the
structure of the FERC Form 1 database based on the strings embedded within the
binary files, pulling out the names of tables and their constituent columns.
The structure of the database is also informed by information we found on the
FERC website, including a mapping between the table names, DBF file names,
and the pages of the Form 1 (add link to file, which should distributed with
the docs) that the data was gathered from, as well as a diagram of the
structure of the database as it existed in 2015 (add link/embed image).

Using this inferred structure PUDL creates an SQLite database mirroring the
FERC database using :mod:`sqlalchemy`. Then we use a python package called
`dbfread <https://dbfread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ to extract the data from
the DBF tables, and insert it virtually unchanged into the SQLite database.
However, we do compile a master table of the all the respondent IDs and
respondent names, which all the other tables refer to. Unlike the other tables,
this table has no ``report_year`` and so it represents a merge of all the years
of data. In the event that the name associated with a given respondent ID has
changed over time, we retain the most recently reported name.

Ths SQLite based compilation of the original FERC Form 1 databases can
accommodate all 116 tables from all the published years of data (beginning in
1994). Including all the data through 2018, the database takes up more than
7GB of disk space. However, almost 90% of that "data" is embeded binary files
in two tables. If those tables are excluded, the database is less than 800MB
in size.

The process of cloning the FERC Form 1 database(s) is coordinated by a script
called ``ferc1_to_sqlite`` implemented in :mod:`pudl.convert.ferc1_to_sqlite`
which is controlled by a YAML file. See the example file distributed with the
package.

Once the cloned SQLite database has been created, we use it as an input into
the PUDL ETL pipeline, and we extract a small subset of the available tables
for further processing and integration with other data sources like the EIA 860
and EIA 923.
