    Fuel costs are reported on a per-plant basis, but we want to estimate them at the

    different types of generators, using different fuels. We have fuel costs broken out
    by type of fuel (coal, oil, gas), and we know which generators use which fuel based
    on their energy_source_code and reported prime_mover. Coal plants use a little bit
    of natural gas or diesel to get started, but based on our analysis of the "pure"
    coal plants, this amounts to only a fraction of a percent of their overal fuel
    consumption on a heat content basis, so we're ignoring it for now.

    For plants whose generators all rely on the same fuel source, we simply attribute
    the fuel costs proportional to the fuel heat content consumption associated with
    each generator.

    For plants with more than one type of generator energy source, we need to split out
    the fuel costs according to fuel type -- so the gas fuel costs are associated with
    generators that have energy_source_code gas, and the coal fuel costs are associated
