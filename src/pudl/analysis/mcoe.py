    Calculate heat rates (mmBTU/MWh) within separable generation units.

    Assumes a "good" Boiler Generator Association (bga) i.e. one that only
    contains boilers and generators which have been completely associated at
    some point in the past.

    The BGA dataframe needs to have the following columns:

    - report_date (annual)
    - plant_id_eia
    - unit_id_pudl
    - generator_id
    - boiler_id

    The unit_id is associated with generation records based on report_date,
    plant_id_eia, and generator_id. Analogously, the unit_id is associtated
    with boiler fuel consumption records based on report_date, plant_id_eia,
    and boiler_id.

    Then the total net generation and fuel consumption per unit per time period
    are calculated, allowing the calculation of a per unit heat rate. That
    per unit heat rate is returned in a dataframe containing:

    fuel costs broken out by type of fuel (coal, oil, gas), and we know which
    generators use which fuel based on their energy_source_code and reported
    prime_mover. Coal plants use a little bit of natural gas or diesel to get
    started, but based on our analysis of the "pure" coal plants, this amounts
    to only a fraction of a percent of their overal fuel consumption on a
    heat content basis, so we're ignoring it for now.

    For plants whose generators all rely on the same fuel source, we simply
    attribute the fuel costs proportional to the fuel heat content consumption
    associated with each generator.

    For plants with more than one type of generator energy source, we need to
    split out the fuel costs according to fuel type -- so the gas fuel costs
    are associated with generators that have energy_source_code gas, and the
