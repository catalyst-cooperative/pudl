"""This module implements experiment tracking tooling using mlflow as a backend.

:class:`ExperimentTracker`'s are created using an op factory :func:`experiment_tracker_factory`
and can be passed around to op's which make up a PUDL model. This class will maintain
state between ops, ensuring that all parameters and metrics are logged to the appropriate
mlflow run. The following command will launch the mlflow UI to view model results:
`mlflow ui --backend-store-uri {tracking_uri}`. `tracking_uri` by default will point
to a file named 'experiments.sqlite' in the base directory of your PUDL repo, but
this is a configurable value, which can be found in the dagster UI.

    The following command will launch the mlflow UI to view model results:
    `mlflow ui --backend-store-uri {tracking_uri}`. From here, you can compare metrics
    from multiple runs, and track performance.

    This class is designed to be created using the `op` :func:`create_experiment_tracker`.
    This allows the `ExperimentTracker` to be passed around within a Dagster `graph`,
    and be used for mlflow logging in any of the `op`'s that make up the `graph`. This
    is useful because Dagster executes `op`'s in separate processes, while mlflow does
    not maintain state between processes. This design also allows configuration of
    the ExperimentTracker to be set from the Dagster UI.

    Currently, we are only doing experiment tracking in a local context, but if we were
    to setup a tracking server, we could point the `tracking_uri` at this remote server
    without having to modify the models. Experiment tracking can also be done outside
    of the PUDL context. If doing exploratory work in a notebook, you can use mlflow
    directly in a notebook with the same experiment name used here, and mlflow will
    seamlessly integrate the results with those from PUDL runs.
