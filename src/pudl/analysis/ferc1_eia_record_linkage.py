"""Connect FERC1 plant tables to EIA's plant-parts via record linkage.

FERC plant records are reported very non-uniformly. In the same table there are records
that are reported as whole plants, individual generators, and collections of prime
movers. This means portions of EIA plants that correspond to a plant record in FERC
Form 1 are heterogeneous, which complicates using the two data sets together.

The EIA plant data is much cleaner and more uniformly structured. The are generators
with ids and plants with ids reported in *seperate* tables. Several generator IDs are
typically grouped under a single plant ID. In :mod:`pudl.analysis.plant_parts_eia`,
we create a large number of synthetic aggregated records representing many possible
slices of a power plant which could in theory be what is actually reported in the FERC
Form 1.

In this module we infer which of the many ``plant_parts_eia`` records is most likely to
correspond to an actually reported FERC Form 1 plant record. this is done with a
logistic regression model. The :mod:`recordlinkage` package helps us create feature
vectors (via :meth:`Features.make_features`) for each candidate match between FERC and
EIA.

We train the logistic regression model using manually labeled training data that links
together several thousand EIA and FERC plant records, and use grid search cross
validation to select a best set of hyperparameters. This trained model is used to
predict matches on the full dataset (see :func:`run_model`). The model can return
multiple EIA match options for each FERC1 record, so we rank the matches and choose the
one with the highest score (see :func:`find_best_matches`). Any matches identified by
the model which are in conflict with our training data are overwritten with the manually
assigned associations (see :func:`overwrite_bad_predictions`). The final match results
are the connections we keep as the matches between FERC1 plant records and EIA
plant-parts.
