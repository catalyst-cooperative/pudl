"""Use the EPA crosswalk to connect EPA units to EIA generators and other data.

A major use case for this dataset is to identify subplants within plant_ids,
which are the smallest coherent units for aggregation.
Despite the name, plant_id refers to a legal entity that often contains
multiple distinct power plants, even of different technology or fuel types.

EPA CEMS data combines information from several parts of a power plant:
* emissions from smokestacks
* fuel use from combustors
* electricty production from generators
But smokestacks, combustors, and generators can be connected in
complex, many-to-many relationships. This complexity makes attribution difficult for,
as an example, allocating pollution to energy producers.
Furthermore, heterogeneity within plant_ids make aggregation
to the parent entity difficult or inappropriate.

But by analyzing the relationships between combustors and generators,
as provided in the EPA/EIA crosswalk, we can identify distinct power plants.
These are the smallest coherent units of aggregation.

In graph analysis terminology, the crosswalk is a list of edges between nodes
(combustors and generators) in a bipartite graph. The networkx python package provides
functions to analyze this edge list and extract disjoint subgraphs (groups of combustors
and generators that are connected to each other).  These are the distinct power plants.
To avoid a name collision with plant_id, we term these collections 'subplants', and
identify them with a subplant_id that is unique within each plant_id. Subplants are thus
identified with the composite key (plant_id, subplant_id).

Through this analysis, we found that 56% of plant_ids contain multiple distinct
subplants, and 11% contain subplants with different technology types, such as a gas
boiler and gas turbine (not in a combined cycle).

Usage Example:

epa_crosswalk_df = pudl.output.epacems.epa_crosswalk()
filtered_crosswalk = filter_crosswalk(epa_crosswalk_df, epacems)
