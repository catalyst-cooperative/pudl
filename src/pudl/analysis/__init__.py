Modules providing programmatic analyses that make use of PUDL data.

The :mod:`pudl.analysis` subpackage is a collection of modules which implement
various systematic analyses using the data compiled by PUDL. Over time this
should grow into a rich library of tools that show how the data can be put to
use. We may also generate post-analysis datapackages for distribution at some
point.
