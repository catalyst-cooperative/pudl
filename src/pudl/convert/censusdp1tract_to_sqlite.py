"""Convert the US Census DP1 ESRI GeoDatabase into an SQLite Database.

This is a thin wrapper around the GDAL ogr2ogr command line tool. We use it
to convert the Census DP1 data which is distributed as an ESRI GeoDB into an
SQLite DB. The module provides ogr2ogr with the Census DP 1 data from the
PUDL datastore, and directs it to be output into the user's SQLite directory
alongside our other SQLite Databases (ferc1.sqlite and pudl.sqlite)

Note that the ogr2ogr command line utility must be available on the user's
system for this to work. This tool is part of the ``pudl-dev`` conda
environment, but if you are using PUDL outside of the conda environment, you
will need to install ogr2ogr separately. On Debian Linux based systems such
as Ubuntu it can be installed with ``sudo apt-get install gdal-bin`` (which
is what we do in our CI setup and Docker images.)
