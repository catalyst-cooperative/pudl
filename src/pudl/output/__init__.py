"""Useful post-processing and denormalized outputs based on PUDL.

The database generated by the PUDL ETL pipeline are well normalized. This minimizes data
duplication and helps avoid many kinds of data corruption and the potential for internal
inconsistency. However, that's not always the easiest kind of data to work with.
Sometimes we want all the names and IDs in a single dataframe or table, for human
readability. Sometimes you want the useful derived values.

This subpackage compiles a bunch of outputs we found we were commonly generating, so
that they can be done automatically and uniformly. They are encapsulated within the

:class: `pudl.output.pudltabl.PudlTabl` class.
