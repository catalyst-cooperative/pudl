    """Assign a PUDL Unit ID to all generators with a given prime mover and fuel.

    Within each plant, assign a Unit ID to all generators that don't have one,
    and that share the same `fuel_type_code_pudl` and `prime_mover_code`. This
    is especially useful for differentiating between different types of steam
    turbine generators, as there are so many different kinds of steam turbines,
    and the only characteristic we have to differentiate between them in this
    context is the fuel they consume. E.g. nuclear, geothermal, solar thermal,
    natural gas, diesel, and coal can all run steam turbines, but it doesn't
    make sense to lump those turbines together into a single unit just because
    they are located at the same plant.

    This routine only assigns a PUDL Unit ID to generators that have a
    consistently reported value of `fuel_type_code_pudl` across all of the years
    of data in `gens_df`. This consistency is important because otherwise the
    prime-fuel based unit assignment could put the same generator into different
    units in different years, which is currently not compatible with our concept
    of "units."

    Args:
        gens_df (pandas.DataFrame): A collection of EIA generator records.
            Must include the ``plant_id_eia``, ``generator_id`` and
            ``prime_mover_code`` and ``unit_id_pudl`` columns.
        prime_mover_code (str): List of prime mover codes for which we are
            attempting to assign simple Unit IDs.
        fuel_type_code_pudl (str): If not None, then limit the records
            assigned a unit_id to those that have the specified
            fuel_type_code_pudl (e.g. "coal", "gas", "oil", "nuclear")
