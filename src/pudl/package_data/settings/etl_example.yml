# This file controls the PUDL ETL process, and is used as input to pudl_etl

# You can create several different settings files if you wish, and specify
# which one the ETL script uses on the command line. e.g.:
#
# pudl_etl custom_pudl_etl.yml

# A "package bundle" is a collection of PUDL data packages that were created
# together in the same ETL process. They should be mutually compatible, and
# can be used together to create a database, or other products. Each package
# bundle needs a name, which will also be the name of the directory into which
# it is written. All the tabular data resources / data packages within a
# package bundle share a unique ID that we use to ensure only compatible data
# is combined.
datapkg_bundle_name: pudl-example

# The package bundle settings are a list of individual data package
# specifications, each of which may contain one or more data sources.
