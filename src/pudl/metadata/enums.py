"""Regions that the EIA uses in their Electricity Market Module analysis.

According to EIA:

The Electricity Market Module (EMM) in the National Energy Modeling System
(NEMS) is made up of four primary submodules: electricity load and demand,
electricity capacity planning, electricity fuel dispatching, and electricity
finance and pricing, as well as the ReStore submodule which interfaces with
both the renewable and electricity modules The EMM also includes nonutility
capacity and generation as well as electricity transmission and trade.

We use 25 electricity supply regions to represent U.S. power markets. The
regions follow North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)
assessment region boundaries and independent system operator (ISO) and regional
transmission organization (RTO) region boundaries (as of early 2019).
Subregions are based on regional pricing zones.
