"""
Code for transforming EIA data that pertains to more than one EIA Form.

This module helps normalize EIA datasets and infers additonal connections
between EIA entities (i.e. utilities, plants, units, generators...). This
includes:

- compiling a master list of plant, utility, boiler, and generator IDs that
  appear in any of the EIA 860 or 923 tables.
- inferring more complete boiler-generator associations.
- differentiating between static and time varying attributes associated with
  the EIA entities, storing the static fields with the entity table, and the
  variable fields in an annual table.

The boiler generator association inferrence (bga) takes the associations
provided by the EIA 860, and expands on it using several methods which can be
found in :func:`pudl.transform.eia._boiler_generator_assn`.

    the number of occurances of each reported record for each entity. With that

        entity_id (list): a list of the id(s) for the entity. Ex: for a plant

    that are mostly consistent. It compiles those consistent records into
    one normalized table.

    There are a few things to note here. First being that we are not expecting
    the outcome here to be perfect! We choose to pull the most consistent
    record as reported across all the EIA tables and years, but we also
    required a "strictness" level of 70% (this is currently a hard coded
    argument for _occurrence_consistency). That means at least 70% of the
    records must be the same for us to use that value. So if values for an
    entity haven't been reported 70% consistently, then it will show up as a
    null value. We built in the ability to add special cases for columns where
    we want to apply a different method to, but the only ones we added was for
    latitude and longitude because they are by far the dirtiest.

    We have determined which columns should be considered "static" or "annual".
    These can be found in constants in the `entities` dictionary. Static means
    That is should not change over time. Annual means there is annual
    variablity. This distinction was made in part by testing the consistency
    and in part by an understanding of how the entities and columns relate in
    the real world.

    Creates a set of more complete boiler generator associations.

    Creates a unique unit_id_pudl for each collection of boilers and generators
    within a plant that have ever been associated with each other, based on
    the boiler generator associations reported in EIA860. Unfortunately, this
    information is not complete for years before 2014, as the gas turbine
    portion of combined cycle power plants in those earlier years were not
    reporting their fuel consumption, or existence as part of the plants.

    For years 2014 and on, EIA860 contains a unit_id_eia value, allowing the
    combined cycle plant compoents to be associated with each other. For many
    plants not listed in the reported boiler generator associations, it is
    nonetheless possible to associate boilers and generators on a one-to-one
    basis, as they use identical strings to describe the units.

    In the end, between the reported BGA table, the string matching, and the
    unit_id_eia values, it's possible to create a nearly complete mapping of
    the generation units, at least for 2014 and later.

    Args:
        eia_transformed_dfs (dict): a dictionary of post-transform dataframes
            representing the EIA database tables.
        eia923_years (list-like): a list of the years of EIA 923 data that
            should be used to infer the boiler-generator associations. By
            default it is all the working years of data.
        eia860_years (list-like): a list of the years of EIA 860 data that
            should be used to infer the boiler-generator associations. By
            default it is all the working years of data.
        debug (bool): If True, include columns in the returned dataframe
            indicating by what method the individual boiler generator
            associations were inferred.

    Returns:
        eia_transformed_dfs (dict): Returns the same dictionary of dataframes
        that was passed in, and adds a new dataframe to it representing
        the boiler-generator associations as records containing
        plant_id_eia, generator_id, boiler_id, and unit_id_pudl

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the boiler - generator association graphs are not
            bi-partite, meaning generators only connect to boilers, and boilers
            only connect to generators.
        AssertionError: If all the boilers do not end up with the same unit_id
            each year.
        AssertionError: If all the generators do not end up with the same
            unit_id each year.
