    "# Catalyst Cooperative Jupyter Notebook Template\n",
    "This notebook lays out a standard format and some best practices for creating interactive / exploratory notebooks which can be relatively easily shared between different PUDL users, and turned into reusable Python modules for integration into our underlying Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Begin with a narrative outline\n",
    "Each notebook should start with a brief explanation (in Markdown) explaining the purpose of the analysis, and outlining the different stages / steps which are taken to accomplish the analysis.\n",
    "As the analysis develops, you can add new sections or details to this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebooks should be runnable\n",
    "Insofar as it's possible, another PUDL user who has cloned the repository that the notebook is part of should be able to update their `pudl-dev` conda environment, open the notebook, and run all cells successfully.\n",
    "If there are required data or other prerequisites that the notebook cannot manage on its own -- like a file that needs to be downloaded by hand and placed in a particular location -- those steps should be laid out clearly at the beginning of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Avoid Troublesome Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Don't hardcode passwords or access tokens\n",
    "Most of our work is done in public Github repositories.\n",
    "No authentication information should ever appear in a notebook.\n",
    "These values can be stored in environment variables on your local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Do not hardocde values, especially late in the notebook\n",
    "If the analysis depends on particular choices of input values, those should be called out explicitly at the beginning of the notebook.\n",
    "(NB: We should explore ways to parameterize notebooks, [papermill](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is one tool that does this).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Don't hardcode absolute file paths\n",
    "If anyone is going to be able to use the notebook, the files it uses will need to be stored somewhere that makes sense on both your and other computers.\n",
    "We assume that anyone using this template has the PUDL package installed, and has a local PUDL data management environment set up.\n",
    "  * Input data that needs to be stored on disk and accessed via a shared location should be saved under `<PUDL_IN>/data/local/<data_source>/`.\n",
    "  * Intermediate saved data products (e.g. a pickled result of a computationally intensive process) and results should be saved to a location relative to the notebook, and within the directory hierarchy of the repository that the notebook is part of.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Don't require avoidable long-running computations\n",
    "Consider persisting to disk the results of computations that take more than a few minutes, if the outputs are small enough to be checked into the repository and shared with other users.\n",
    "Only require the expensive computation to be run if this pre-computed output is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Don't litter\n",
    "Don't leave lots of additional code laying around, even commented out, \"just in case\" you want to look at it again later.\n",
    "Notebooks need to be relatively linear in the end, even though the thought processes and exploratory analyses that generate them may not be.\n",
    "Once you have a working analysis, either prune those branches, or encapsulate them as options within functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Don't load unneccesary libraries\n",
    "Only import libraries which are required by the notebook, to avoid unnecessary dependencies.\n",
    "If your analysis requires a new library that isn't yet part of the shared `pudl-dev` environment, add it to the `devtools/environment.yml` file so that others will get it when they update their environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Related Resources:\n",
    "Lots of these guidelines are taken directly from Emily Riederer's post: [RMarkdown Driven Development](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/rmarkdown-driven-development/).\n",

    "* Put all import statements at the top of the notebook, so everyone can see what its dependencies are up front, and so that if an import is going to fail, it fails early, before the rest of the notebook is run.\n",
    "* Try to avoid importing individual functions and classes from deep within packages, as it may not be clear to other users where those elements came from, later in the notebook, and also to minimize the chance of namespace collisions."
