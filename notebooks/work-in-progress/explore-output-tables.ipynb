    "There are many ways to access the data extracted and manipulated by pudl. You can query the SQL database where the **XX** data live **(link to that notebook)**, use Dask to access the CEMS parquet files, work with cleaned, csv versions of the raw files, or interact with pudl's various output table objects. This notebook provides a walk-through of the output tables, their contents, and their capabilities. \n",

    "#### What are the output tables?\n",
    "\n",
    "The database houses the bulk of the data, but it may not be immediately clear how it can or ought to be assembled for analysis. The output tables are select replications and manipulations of the raw data that use the cleaned and processed data from in the database. The database stores tidy data **(link to tidy data)**, and the output tables pipe that data into a more user-friendly, format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output tables are not just “clean” versions of their raw inputs. Many of the dataframes closely mimic their raw counterparts, but most have undergone data transformations such as unit and aggregation alteration, column condensation, and more. Some of the tables present unique data manipulations, calculations, or inter-source conglomerations that cannot be \"found\" in a raw format. The intent of the output tables is to provide quick and intuitive access to relevant groups of data."

Many plants -- especially coal plants -- use more than one fuel, with gas and/or diesel serving as startup fuels. In order to be able to classify the type of plant based on relative proportions of fuel consumed or fuel costs it is useful to aggregate these per-fuel records into a single record for each plant. Fuel cost (in nominal dollars) and fuel heat content (in mmBTU) are calculated for each fuel based on the cost and heat content per unit, and the number of units consumed, and then summed by fuel type (there can be more than one record for a given type of fuel in each plant because we are simplifying the fuel categories). The per-fuel records are then pivoted to create one column per fuel type. The total is summed and stored separately, and the individual fuel costs & heat contents are divided by that total, to yield fuel proportions.  Based on those proportions and a minimum threshold that's passed in, a \"primary\" fuel type is then assigned to the plant-year record and given a string label.|\n",
