# The following settings determine which data is loaded by init_pudl.py

# You can create several different settings files if you wish, and specify
# which one the initialization script uses on the command line:
#
# ./init_pudl.py settings_init_pudl_custom.yml
#
# The default settings load nothing into the database, but there are commented
# out lines enumerating the full extent of the currently loadable data, which
# you can un-comment or edit to suit your data analysis.
