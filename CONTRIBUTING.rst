Contributing Code to PUDL
-------------------------

Welcome! We're so glad you're interested in contributing to PUDL! We would love
some help making PUDL data as complete as possible.

.. _after-intro:

.. IMPORTANT:: Already have a dataset in mind?

   If you **need data that's not in PUDL**, `open an issue
   <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new-data&projects=&template=new_dataset.md&title=>`__
   to tell us more about it!

   If you've **already spent a bunch of time wrangling a dataset**, we welcome
   "knowledge contributions" in our `pudl-knowledge
   <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl-knowledge>`__ repository!

   If you're **looking to help us integrate a specific dataset into PUDL**, find us at
   `office hours <https://calend.ly/catalyst-cooperative/pudl-office-hours>`__ and we
   can talk through next steps.


Your first contribution
-----------------------

**Setup**

You'll need to fork this repository and get the
`dev environment set up <https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/nightly/dev/dev_setup.html>`__.

**Pick an issue**

* Look for issues with the `good first issue
  <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agood-first-issue>`__
  tag in our `Community Kanban Board
  <https://github.com/orgs/catalyst-cooperative/projects/9/views/19>`__. These
  are issues that don't require a ton of PUDL-specific context, and are
  relatively tightly scoped.

* Comment on the issue and tag ``@catalyst-cooperative/com-dev`` (our Community
  Development Team) to let us know you're working on it. Feel free to ask any
  questions you might have!

* Once you have an idea of how you want to tackle this issue, write out your
  plan so we can guide you around obstacles in your way! Post a comment outlining:

  * what steps have you broken this down into?
  * what is the output of each step?
  * how will one know that each step is working?

* Once you've talked through your plan with someone from Catalyst, go forth and
  develop!

**Work on it!**

* Make a branch on your fork and open a draft pull request (PR) early so we can
  discuss concrete code! **Set the base branch to ``main``.** Please don't wait
  until it's all polished up - it's much easier for us to help you when we can
  see the code evolve over time.

* Please make sure to write tests and documentation for your code - if you run
  into trouble with writing tests, let us know in the comments and we can help!
  We automatically run the test suite for all PRs, but some of those will have
  to be manually approved by Catalyst members for safety reasons.

* **Try to keep your changes relatively small:** stuff happens, and one's
  bandwidth for volunteer work can fluctuate frequently. If you make a bunch of
  small changes, it's much easier to pause on a project without losing a ton of
  context. We try to keep PRs to **less than 500 lines of code.**

**Get it merged in!**

* Turn the draft PR into a normal PR and tag ``@catalyst-cooperative/com-dev``
  in a comment. We'll try to get back to you within a few days - the
  smaller/simpler the PR, the faster we'll be able to get back to you.

* The reviewer will leave comments - if they request changes, address their
  concerns and re-request review.

* There will probably be some back-and-forth until your PR is approved - this
  is normal and a sign of good communication on your part! Don't be shy about
  asking us for updates and re-requesting review!

* Don't accidentally "start a review" when responding to comments! If this does
  happen, don't forget to submit the review you've started so the other PR
  participants can see your comments (they are invisible to others if marked
  "Pending").

Next contributions
------------------

Hooray! You made your first contribution! To find another issue to tackle, check
out the `Community Kanban board
<https://github.com/orgs/catalyst-cooperative/projects/9/views/19>`__ where
we've picked out some issues that are

* useful to work on

* unlikely to become super time-sensitive

* have some context, success criteria, and next steps information.

Pick one of these and follow the contribution flow above!
