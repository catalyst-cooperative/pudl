What is PUDL?
-------------

The `PUDL <https://catalyst.coop/pudl/>`__ Project is an open source data processing
pipeline that makes US energy data easier to access and use programmatically.

Hundreds of gigabytes of valuable data are published by US government agencies, but it's
often difficult to work with. PUDL takes the original spreadsheets, CSV files, and
databases and turns them into a unified resource. This allows users to spend more time
on novel analysis and less time on data preparation.

The project is focused on serving researchers, activists, journalists, policy makers,
and small businesses that might not otherwise be able to afford access to this data from
commercial sources and who may not have the time or expertise to do all the data
processing themselves from scratch.

We want to make this data accessible and easy to work with for as wide an audience as
possible: anyone from a grassroots youth climate organizers working with Google sheets
to university researchers with access to scalable cloud computing resources and everyone
in between!

PUDL is comprised of three core components:

Raw Data Archives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
PUDL `archives <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl-archiver>`__ all our raw
inputs on `Zenodo
<https://zenodo.org/communities/catalyst-cooperative/?page=1&size=20>`__ to ensure
permanent, versioned access to the data. In the event that an agency changes how they
publish data or deletes old files, the data processing pipeline will still have access
to the original inputs. Each of the data inputs may have several different versions
archived, and all are assigned a unique DOI (digital object identifier) and made
available through Zenodo's REST API.  You can read more about the Raw Data Archives in
the `docs <https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/nightly/#raw-data-archives>`__.

Data Pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The data pipeline (this repo) ingests raw data from the archives, cleans and integrates
it, and writes the resulting tables to `SQLite <https://sqlite.org>`__ and `Apache
Parquet <https://parquet.apache.org/>`__ files, with some acompanying metadata stored as
JSON.  Each release of the PUDL software contains a set of of DOIs indicating which
versions of the raw inputs it processes. This helps ensure that the outputs are
replicable. You can read more about our ETL (extract, transform, load) process in the
`PUDL documentation <https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/nightly/#the-etl-process>`__.

Data Warehouse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The SQLite, Parquet, and JSON outputs from the data pipeline, sometimes called "PUDL
outputs", are updated each night by an automated build process, and periodically
archived so that users can access the data without having to install and run our data
processing system. These outputs contain hundreds of tables and comprise a small
file-based data warehouse that can be used for a variety of energy system analyses.
