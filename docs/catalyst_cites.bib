abstract = {The Micro-level Engineering, Economic, and Environmental Detail of Electricity (MEEDE, Version 2) dataset provides a unit-level representation of the United States electricity sector based on public sources. The data draw on a disparate set of engineering,
environmental, and economic data, primarily from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, to characterize all utility-scale electric generating units in the U.S. in terms of their physical inputs of energy, outputs of electricity and pollution, generating and pollution control equipment configurations, and economic costs (capital, labor, energy, and materials) associated with their operation. The combination of complete unit-level physical details of the US grid with economic characteristics is a key distinction between the MEEDE data and other publicly-available sources. The MEEDE data provide a highly-valuable tool for generating descriptive statistics and supporting advanced partial or general equilibrium modeling efforts that require technology-rich representations of the U.S. electricity grid. We demonstrate how these data can be integrated into social accounting matrices for use in economy-wide modeling applications.}

abstract = {Grid reliability in Texas is an increasingly highlighted concern due to recent winter storms and heat waves threatening the reliability of the power sector. In this analysis, we compare two improvements on power grid reliability: building more firm generation capacity and connecting the Texas electricity grid to other regions, like WECC. To do so, we created a novel analytical framework that is comprised of the following four elements: (1) integration of open-source modeling tools, such as PowerGenome, pyGRETA, and GenX; (2) synthesis of multiple datasets containing information on historic weather, existing power fleet, energy technology performance factors, future projections of economics, etc.; (3) development of unique zonal profiles for load projections and weather dependent renewable resource performance; and (4) a newly consolidated network of 20 model regions representing the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the grid that serves most of Texas, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), the grid that serves the western half of the contiguous US. Our flexible modeling approach can be applied globally to other grid modeling regions, though the method is demonstrated in this work with unique zonal profiles and a 20-region network, specific to our use case of connecting ERCOT to WECC. These 20 regions were used to simulate different developmental pathways of capacity expansion and operational dispatch across the combined regions while simultaneously optimizing cost and avoiding outage events by planning for winter storm. The primary focus of our work is to analyze the trade-offs of connecting two independently functioning grids and how their future development might be impacted. This analysis considered eight primary forward-looking grid modeling scenarios in ERCOT and WECC. We also completed two sensitivity analyses on some of the critical parameters needed to define the eight primary scenarios. All analyses found that building power plants and transmission connecting ERCOT and WECC lowers total system cost and avoids future CO2 emissions across both regions when compared to solely expanding ERCOT’s power plant capacity. Further, the analyses found that plant hardening and weatherization is important, and can be done in parallel with transmission development for maximum benefit.}

This study provides a general framework to evaluate any potential demand sink technology and understand its viability to be deployed cost-effectively in low-carbon power systems. We use an electricity system optimization model to assess 98 discrete combinations of capital costs and output values that collectively span the range of feasible characteristics of potential demand sink technologies. We find that candidates like hydrogen electrolysis, direct air capture, and flexible electric heating can all achieve significant installed capacity (>10% of system peak load) if lower capital costs are reached in the future. Demand sink technologies significantly increase installed wind and solar capacity while not significantly affecting battery storage, firm generating capacity, or the average cost of electricity.}

  journal = {Environmental Research: Energy},
  abstract = {Runtime and memory requirements for typical formulations of energy system models increase non-linearly with resolution, computationally constraining large-scale models despite state-of-the-art solvers and hardware. This scaling paradigm requires omission of detail which can affect key outputs to an unknown degree. Recent algorithmic innovations employing decomposition have enabled linear increases in runtime and memory use as temporal resolution increases. Newly tractable, higher resolution systems can be compared with lower resolution configurations commonly employed today in academic research and industry practice, providing a better understanding of the potential biases or inaccuracies introduced by these abstractions. We employ a state-of-the art electricity system planning model and new high-resolution systems to quantify the impact of varying degrees of spatial, temporal, and operational resolution on results salient to policymakers and planners. We find models with high spatial and temporal resolution result in more realistic siting decisions and improved emissions, reliability, and price outcomes. Errors are generally larger in systems with low spatial resolution, which omit key transmission constraints. We demonstrate that high temporal resolution cannot overcome biases introduced by low spatial resolution, and vice versa. While we see asymptotic improvements to total system cost and reliability with increased resolution, other salient outcomes such as siting accuracy and emissions exhibit continued improvement across the range of model resolutions considered. We conclude that modelers should carefully balance resolution on spatial, temporal, and operational dimensions and that novel computational methods enabling higher resolution modeling are valuable and can further improve the decision support provided by this class of models.}

      intermittent nature presents challenges. Significant temporal and geographic
      differences in land, wind, and solar resources suggest that long-distance
      transmission could be particularly beneficial. Using a detailed, open-source
      model, we analyze optimal transmission expansion jointly with storage, generation,
      and hourly operations across the three primary interconnects in the United States.
      Transmission expansion offers far more benefits in a high-renewable system than in
      a system with mostly conventional generation. Yet while an optimal nationwide plan
      would have more than triple current interregional transmission, transmission
      decreases the cost of a 100% clean system by only 4% compared to a plan that
      relies solely on current transmission. Expanding capacity only within existing
      interconnects can achieve most of these savings. Adjustments to energy storage and
      generation mix can leverage the current interregional transmission infrastructure
      to build a clean power system at a reasonable cost.}

                 Events in 2021 have brought the extreme levels of price and supply volatility
                 present in the global gas market to the fore of discussions over future energy
                 system dynamics.  Wholesale gas prices have risen to record highs across key supply
                 hubs, highlighting the levels of  market  risk  that  gas-fired  power stations  are
                 exposed  to,  and demonstrating  the  urgent  requirement for increased investment
                 in alternative forms of flexible supply which are steadily emerging.  Even before
                 this year’s crisis however, gas-fired power stations across Europe and the US were
                 already  confronting  declining operating  profitability and rapidly  growing
                 competition  from  low carbon sources. A steady shift towards the primary use of
                 such technologies is vital if net zero emissions goals are to be achieved.  While
                 small amounts of unabated gas-fired capacity may well be required to remain
                 available in these regions and to sit predominantly idle as back up peaking capacity

            interruption hours during that hurricane was relatively lower for regions of
            the Florida distribution grid that invested more in interoperability
            enhancements, all else being equal. We use advanced metering infrastructure
            penetration as a proxy and leading indica- tor of investment in
            interoperability enhancements. Employing only publicly available data
            resources, we conservatively estimate that Florida counties that made these
            investments re- alized nearly $1.7 billion of operational resilience
            benefits in the form of avoided customer interruption costs during Hurricane
            Irma.}

  abstract = {Energy systems models are used to perform energy and environmental policy
              analysis, inform company strategy, and understand implications of technological
              change. Although open-source models can promote transparency and reproducibility, data
              availability and cost can be prohibitive barriers for researchers and other
              stakeholders. This paper presents a novel application of a statistical approach to
              predict unknown power plant parameters in Canada using available data from the United
              States, which can be applied in other settings where critical model inputs are
              missing. We apply two statistical learning methods, linear regression and
              k-nearest-neighbors, and compare their performance on unseen portions of the United
              States data before applying the learned functions to unknown Canadian data. Results
              indicate that reasonable predictions of heatrates and, to a lesser extent, operation
              and maintenance costs are possible even with limited data about age, capacity, and
              power plant types. The nearest-neighbor approach generally outperforms linear
              regressions for the datasets and applications to power plant parameters investigated
              here.}
