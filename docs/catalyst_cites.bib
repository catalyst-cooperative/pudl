                 to backup reserve to allow for flexible low carbon forms of supply to fully emerge.
                 Events in 2021 have brought the extreme levels of price and supply volatility
                 present in the global gas market to the fore of discussions over future energy
                 system dynamics.  Wholesale gas prices have risen to record highs across key supply
                 hubs, highlighting the levels of  market  risk  that  gas-fired  power stations  are
                 exposed  to,  and demonstrating  the  urgent  requirement for increased investment
                 in alternative forms of flexible supply which are steadily emerging.  Even before
                 this year’s crisis however, gas-fired power stations across Europe and the US were
                 already  confronting  declining operating  profitability and rapidly  growing
                 competition  from  low carbon sources. A steady shift towards the primary use of
                 such technologies is vital if net zero emissions goals are to be achieved.  While
                 small amounts of unabated gas-fired capacity may well be required to remain
                 available in these regions and to sit predominantly idle as back up peaking capacity
                 to ensure long- term system supply security, we believe that this should be the
                 limit to such units’ future role.  This report aims to demonstrate that stakeholders
                 committing to the long-term funding of such assets are already risking the loss of
                 billions of dollars, while the risks of continued investment will only grow
                 further.},

  abstract = {Energy systems models are used to perform energy and environmental policy
              analysis, inform company strategy, and understand implications of technological
              change. Although open-source models can promote transparency and reproducibility, data
              availability and cost can be prohibitive barriers for researchers and other
              stakeholders. This paper presents a novel application of a statistical approach to
              predict unknown power plant parameters in Canada using available data from the United
              States, which can be applied in other settings where critical model inputs are
              missing. We apply two statistical learning methods, linear regression and
              k-nearest-neighbors, and compare their performance on unseen portions of the United
              States data before applying the learned functions to unknown Canadian data. Results
              indicate that reasonable predictions of heatrates and, to a lesser extent, operation
              and maintenance costs are possible even with limited data about age, capacity, and
              power plant types. The nearest-neighbor approach generally outperforms linear
              regressions for the datasets and applications to power plant parameters investigated
              here.}
