                 to backup reserve to allow for flexible low carbon forms of supply to fully emerge.
                 Events in 2021 have brought the extreme levels of price and supply volatility
                 present in the global gas market to the fore of discussions over future energy
                 system dynamics.  Wholesale gas prices have risen to record highs across key supply
                 hubs, highlighting the levels of  market  risk  that  gas-fired  power stations  are
                 exposed  to,  and demonstrating  the  urgent  requirement for increased investment
                 in alternative forms of flexible supply which are steadily emerging.  Even before
                 this year’s crisis however, gas-fired power stations across Europe and the US were
                 already  confronting  declining operating  profitability and rapidly  growing
                 competition  from  low carbon sources. A steady shift towards the primary use of
                 such technologies is vital if net zero emissions goals are to be achieved.  While
                 small amounts of unabated gas-fired capacity may well be required to remain
                 available in these regions and to sit predominantly idle as back up peaking capacity
                 to ensure long- term system supply security, we believe that this should be the
                 limit to such units’ future role.  This report aims to demonstrate that stakeholders
                 committing to the long-term funding of such assets are already risking the loss of
                 billions of dollars, while the risks of continued investment will only grow
                 further.},

  abstract = {Energy systems models are used to perform energy and environmental policy
              analysis, inform company strategy, and understand implications of technological
              change. Although open-source models can promote transparency and reproducibility, data
              availability and cost can be prohibitive barriers for researchers and other
              stakeholders. This paper presents a novel application of a statistical approach to
              predict unknown power plant parameters in Canada using available data from the United
              States, which can be applied in other settings where critical model inputs are
              missing. We apply two statistical learning methods, linear regression and
              k-nearest-neighbors, and compare their performance on unseen portions of the United
              States data before applying the learned functions to unknown Canadian data. Results
              indicate that reasonable predictions of heatrates and, to a lesser extent, operation
              and maintenance costs are possible even with limited data about age, capacity, and
              power plant types. The nearest-neighbor approach generally outperforms linear
              regressions for the datasets and applications to power plant parameters investigated
              here.}

      abstract={Solar and wind power are cost-competitive with fossil fuels, yet their
      intermittent nature presents challenges. Significant temporal and geographic
      differences in land, wind, and solar resources suggest that long-distance
      transmission could be particularly beneficial. Using a detailed, open-source
      model, we analyze optimal transmission expansion jointly with storage, generation,
      and hourly operations across the three primary interconnects in the United States.
      Transmission expansion offers far more benefits in a high-renewable system than in
      a system with mostly conventional generation. Yet while an optimal nationwide plan
      would have more than triple current interregional transmission, transmission
      decreases the cost of a 100% clean system by only 4% compared to a plan that
      relies solely on current transmission. Expanding capacity only within existing
      interconnects can achieve most of these savings. Adjustments to energy storage and
      generation mix can leverage the current interregional transmission infrastructure
      to build a clean power system at a reasonable cost.}

      While the cost of renewable generation has declined dramatically, integrating
      these renewables would require a large expansion in transmission to deliver that
      power. Already there is growing evidence that the United States has insufficient
      transmission capacity, and current levels of annual investment are well below what
      would be required for a renewables-dominated system. We describe a variety of

            important to enable effective and targeted action to decarbonize the

            including environmental economics, lifecycle assessment, and environmental
            health. To inform the broadest range of use cases, such data should ideally
            have a high temporal and spatial resolution, be available in as close to
            real-time as possible, represent the complete power sector, use the
            highest-quality measured data, have complete historical coverage, and
            represent both generated and consumed emissions. To date, no published
            datasets have achieved all of these characteristics. This work is the first
            to publish a comprehensive, plant-level dataset of hourly-resolution
            generation, fuel consumption, and direct CO2, NOx, and SO2 emissions for the
            entire U.S. power sector. This data is published as part of the public and
            open-source Open Grid Emissions Initiative, which also includes hourly,
            consumption-based emissions intensities for every grid balancing area in the

            interrogates how several of the assumptions implicit in the use of existing
            power sector emissions datasets may under-count or misrepresent the climate
            and health impacts of air emissions from the U.S. power sector. We envision
            the Initiative becoming a central repository of, and hub of activity for
            addressing open research questions related to power sector emissions data,
            and the go-to source for high-quality, high-resolution data for future
            research on grid emissions.}
