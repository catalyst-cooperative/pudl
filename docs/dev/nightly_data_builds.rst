Nightly Data Builds
===============================================================================

The complete ETL and tests run every night on a Google Compute Engine (GCE)
instance so new code merged into ``dev`` can be fully tested. These complete builds
also enable continuous deployment of PUDL's data outputs.

The builds are kicked off by the ``build-deploy-pudl`` GitHub Action, which builds and
pushes a Docker image with PUDL installed to `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/catalystcoop/pudl-etl>`__
and deploys the image as a container to a GCE instance. The container runs the ETL and
tests, then copies the outputs to a public AWS s3 bucket for distribution.

Breaking the Builds
-------------------
The nightly data builds based on the ``dev`` branch are our comprehensive integration
tests. When they pass, we consider the results fit for public consumption.  The builds
are expected to pass. If they don't then someone needs to take responsibility for
getting them working again with some urgency.

Because of how long the full build & tests take, we donâ€™t typically run them
individually before merging every PR into ``dev``. However, running ``make nuke``
(the equivalent of the full builds) is recommended when you've added a new year of data
or made other changes that would be expected to break the data validations, so that the
appropriate changes can be made prior to those changes hitting ``dev`` and the nightly
builds.

If your PR causes the build to fail, you are probably the best person to fix the
problem, since you already have context on all of the changes that went into it.

Having multiple PRs merged into ``dev`` simultaneously when the builds are breaking
makes it ambiguous where the problem is coming from, makes debugging harder, and
diffuses responsibility for the breakage across several people, so it's important to fix
the breakage quickly. In some cases we may delay merging additional PRs into ``dev``
if the builds are failing to avoid ambiguity and facilitate debugging.

Therefore, we've adopted the following etiquette regarding build breakage: On the
morning after you merge a PR into ``dev``, you should check whether the nightly builds
succeeded by looking in the ``pudl-deployments`` Slack channel (which all team members
should be subscribed to). If the builds failed, look at the logging output (which is
included as an attachment to the notification) and figure out what kind of failure
occurred:

  * If the failure is due to your changes, then you are responsible for fixing the
    problem and making a new PR to ``dev`` that resolves it, and it should be a high
    priority. If you're stumped, ask for help!
  * If the failure is due to an infrastructural issue like the build server running out
    of memory and the build process getting killed, then you need to notify the member
    who is in charge of managing the builds (Currently :user:`bendnorman`), and hand off
    responsibility for debugging and fixing the issue.
  * If the failure is the result of a transient problem outside of our control like a
    network connection failing, then wait until the next morning and repeat the above
    process. If the "transient" problem persists, bring it up with the person
    managing the builds.

Debugging a Broken Build
------------------------

If a build has failed, usually the VM will have shut down. You'll have to figure out
which VM it was running on and then restart it before you can do anything else.

To find the VM name, go into the `Github Action listing
<https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/actions/workflows/build-deploy-pudl.yml>`__
and click on your run. The ``GCE_INSTANCE_NAME`` that gets printed in "Print
action vars" is what you're after.

Then you can go to the `Google Compute Engine
<https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances?project=catalyst-cooperative-pudl>`__
page and restart it.

Once that's started, you should be able to SSH to the VM via ``gcloud ssh
vm-name``. You may run into some permissions issues here, in which case you
probably need the ``Service Account User`` role on your gcloud user.

Now you want to get some logs about what's failing.

First, try ``docker ps`` - this should show two images, one ``pudl``-ey one and
one that's the Google ``stackdriver-agent`` which handles monitoring::

   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                     <snip>  NAMES
   d678f709d1f5   catalystcoop/pudl-etl...  <snip>  klt-pudl-deployment-tag-luui
   aa3163671da4   gcr.io/stackdriver-ag...  <snip>  stackdriver-logging-agent

If the image is running, great! You can get logs via ``docker logs
<container ID or name>`` (use ``docker logs -f`` if the process is still
going and you want to stream logs from the container.)

You can also attach a shell to the container and poke around with ``docker exec
-it <ID or name> bash``. This is really helpful if something has failed and you
want to try to fix the code & re-run, without having to re-run everything
before the failed task.

.. Warning::

   If you use ``docker attach`` as recommended by the login message, and then
   hit Ctrl-C, you will interrupt the running build!

Sometimes you'll see two containers running, but neither of them are PUDL.
That's because the VM first spins up a "loader" container that downloads the
PUDL image, then exits the loader and starts the PUDL image.

If you don't see two containers running, then there's probably some issue with
the PUDL container startup itself. To find logs about that, run ``sudo
journalctl -u konlet-startup | tail -n 1000 | less``. You should be able to see
any errors that occurred during container startup, and also the container ID,
which you can then boot into via ``docker run -it <ID> bash``.


The GitHub Action
-----------------
The ``build-deploy-pudl`` GitHub action contains the main coordination logic for
the Nightly Data Builds. The action is triggered every night and when new tags are
pushed to the PUDL repository. This way, new data outputs are automatically updated
on code releases, and PUDL's code and data are tested every night. The action is
modeled after an `example from the setup-gcloud GitHub action repository <https://github.com/google-github-actions/setup-gcloud/tree/main/example-workflows/gce>`__.

Unfortunately, scheduled actions only run on the default branch. To run scheduled
builds on the ``dev`` branch, the `actions/checkout <https://github.com/actions/checkout>`__
step checks out the ``dev`` branch if a schedule triggers the action and the ``main``
branch if a tag triggers the action.

The ``gcloud`` command in ``build-deploy-pudl`` requires certain Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) permissions to start and update the GCE instance. The
``gcloud`` command authenticates using a service account key for the
``deploy-pudl-github-action`` service account stored in PUDL's GitHub secrets
as ``DEPLOY_PUDL_SA_KEY``. The ``deploy-pudl-github-action`` service account has
the `Compute Instance Admin (v1) IAM <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#compute-engine>`__
role on the GCE instances to update the container and start the instance.

Google Compute Engine
---------------------
The PUDL image is deployed on a `Container Optimized GCE
<https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/concepts/features-and-benefits>`__
instance, a type of virtual machine (VM) built to run containers. The
``pudl-deployment-dev`` and ``pudl-deployment-tag`` instances in the
``catalyst-cooperative-pudl`` GCP project handle deployments from the ``dev`` branch and
tags, respectively. There are two VMs so a scheduled and a tag build can run
at the same time.

.. note::

    If a tag build starts before the previous tag build has finished, the previous build
    will be interrupted.

PUDL's VMs use the e2-highmem-8 machine type (64 GB of RAM and 8 CPUs) to accommodate
the PUDL ETL's memory-intensive steps. Currently, these VMs do not have swap space
enabled.

Each GCE VM has a service account that gives the VM permissions to GCP resources.
The two PUDL deployment VMs share the ``deploy-pudl-vm-service-account``. This
service account has permissions to:

1. Write logs to Cloud Logging.
2. Start and stop the VM so the container can shut the instance off when the ETL
   is complete, so Catalyst does not incur unnecessary charges.
3. Bill the ``catalyst-cooperative-pudl`` project for egress fees from accessing
   the ``zenodo-cache.catalyst.coop`` bucket. Note: The ``catalyst-cooperative-pudl``
   won't be charged anything because the data stays within Google's network.
4. Write logs and outputs to the ``gs://nightly-build-outputs.catalyst.coop``,
   ``gs://pudl.catalyst.coop`` and ``s3://pudl.catalyst.coop`` buckets.
   The egress and storage fees of the s3 bucket are covered by
   `Amazon Web Services's Open Data Sponsorship Program
   <https://aws.amazon.com/opendata/open-data-sponsorship-program/>`__.

Docker
------
The Docker image the VMs pull installs PUDL into a mamba environment. The VMs
are configured to run the ``docker/gcp_pudl_etl.sh`` script. This script:

1. Notifies the ``pudl-deployments`` Slack channel that a deployment has started.
   Note: if the container is manually stopped, slack will not be notified.
2. Runs the ETL and full test suite.
3. Copies the outputs and logs to a directory in the ``pudl-etl-logs`` bucket. The
   directory is named using the git SHA of the commit that launched the build.
4. Copies the outputs to the ``gs://pudl.catalyst.coop`` and ``s3://pudl.catalyst.coop``
   buckets if the ETL and test suite run successfully.
5. Notifies the ``pudl-deployments`` Slack channel with the final build status.

The ``gcp_pudl_etl.sh script`` is only intended to run on a GCE VM with adequate
permissions. The full ETL and tests can be run locally by running these commands
from the ``pudl`` directory:

.. code-block::

    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build
    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up

How to access the nightly build outputs from AWS
------------------------------------------------
To access the nightly build outputs you can download
the data directly from the ``s3://pudl.catalyst.coop`` bucket. To do this, you'll
need to `follow the instructions
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html>`__
for installing the AWS CLI tool.

To test that the AWS CLI tool and the bucket are working properly, run:

.. code-block::

   aws s3 ls s3://pudl.catalyst.coop --no-sign-request

You should see a list of directories with version names:

.. code-block::

   PRE dev/
   PRE v2022.11.30/
   ...

The ``--no-sign-request`` flag allows you to make requsts to the
public bucket without having to load AWS credentials. If you don't
include this flag when interacting with the ``s3://pudl.catalyst.coop``
bucket, ``aws`` will give you an authentication error.

.. warning::

   If you download the files directly with ``aws`` then you'll be responsible for
   updating them, making sure you have the right version, putting them in the right
   place on your computer, etc.

To copy these files directly to your computer you can use
the ``aws s3 cp`` command, which behaves very much like the Unix ``cp`` command:

.. code::

   aws s3 cp s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/dev/pudl.sqlite ./ --no-sign-request

If you wanted to download all of the build outputs (more than 10GB!) you could use ``cp
--recursive`` flag on the whole directory:

.. code::

   aws s3 cp --recursive s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/dev/ ./ --no-sign-request

For more details on how to use ``aws`` in general see the
`online documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/>`__ or run:

.. code::

   aws help

How to access the nightly build outputs and logs (for the Catalyst team only)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes it is helpful to download the logs and data outputs of
nightly builds when debugging failures. To do this you'll need to
set up the Google Cloud software Development Kit (SDK).

Install the `gcloud utilities <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install>`__ on your
computer. There are several ways to do this. We recommend using ``conda`` or its faster
sibling ``mamba``. If you're not using ``conda`` environments, there are other
ways to install the Google Cloud SDK explained in the link above.

.. code::

  conda install -c conda-forge google-cloud-sdk

Log into the account you used to create your new project above by running:

.. code::

  gcloud auth login

Initialize the ``gcloud`` command line interface and select the
``catalyst-cooperative-pudl`` project.

If it asks you whether you want to "re-initialize this configuration with new settings"
say yes.

.. code::

  gcloud init

Finally, use ``gcloud`` to establish application default credentials; this will allow
the project to be used for requester pays access through applications:

.. code::

  gcloud auth application-default login

To test whether your GCP account is set up correctly and authenticated you can run the
following command to list the contents of the cloud storage bucket containing the PUDL
data. This doesn't actually download any data, but will show you the versions
that are available:

.. code::

   gsutil ls gs://nightly-build-outputs.catalyst.coop

You should see a list of directories with the naming convention
``<git commit SHA>-<git branch>``.

To see what the outputs are for a given nightly build, you can use ``gsutil``
like this:

.. code::

   gsutil ls -l gs://nightly-build-outputs.catalyst.coop/<build name of interest>

      1152800  2022-11-22T12:51:02Z  gs://nightly-build-outputs.catalyst.coop/<build name of interest>/pudl-etl.log
                                 gs://nightly-build-outputs.catalyst.coop/<build name of interest>/parquet/
                                 gs://nightly-build-outputs.catalyst.coop/<build name of interest>/pudl_out/
                                 gs://nightly-build-outputs.catalyst.coop/<build name of interest>/sqlite/
   TOTAL: 1 objects, 1152800 bytes (1.1 MiB)

If you want to copy these files down directly to your computer, you can use
the ``gsutil cp`` command, which behaves very much like the Unix ``cp`` command:

.. code::

   gsutil cp gs://nightly-build-outputs.catalyst.coop/<build name of interest>/pudl.sqlite ./

If you wanted to download all of the build outputs (more than 10GB!) you could use ``cp
-r`` on the whole directory:

.. code::

   gsutil cp -r gs://nightly-build-outputs.catalyst.coop/<build name of interest>/ ./

For more details on how to use ``gsutil`` in general see the
`online documentation <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil>`__ or run:

.. code::

   gsutil --help
