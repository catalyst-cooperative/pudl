Raw FERC Form 1 Data Dictionary
===============================================================================

We have mapped the Visual FoxPro DBF files to their corresponding FERC Form 1
database tables and provided a short description of the contents of each table here.

.. note::

   * The mapping of File Name to Table Name is consistent across all years of data.
   * Page numbers correspond to the pages of the FERC Form 1 PDF as it appeared in
     2015 and may not be valid for other years.
   * Many tables without descriptions were discontinued prior to 2015.
   * The "Freq" column indicates the reporting frequency -- A for Annual; Q for
     Quarterly. A/Q if the data is reported both annually and quarterly.

.. note::

   As of 2025-09-08 the links below are not working, because we are in the process of
   migrating web-based access to PUDL data to `a new interface
   <https://viewer.catalyst.coop>`__. The links should start working again once we have
   `added the raw FERC DBs to the PUDL Viewer
   <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/eel-hole/issues/4>`__ and `implemented
   per-table direct links
   <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/eel-hole/issues/56>`__
