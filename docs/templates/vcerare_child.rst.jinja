{% block availability %}
Hourly, county-level data from 2019 - 2023 is integrated into PUDL. There is a
second release of data for the years 2014 - 2018 expected in Q1 of 2025, which will be
integrated into PUDL pending funding availability.

You can explore the VCE RARE dataset with
`this Jupyter notebook on Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/code/catalystcooperative/04-renewable-generation-profiles>`__.

{% block original_data %}
The contents of the original CSVs are formatted so that Excel can display the
data without crashing. There's one file per year per generation type, and each
file contains an index column for time (simply 1, 2, 3...8760 to
represent the hours in a year) and columns for each county populated with capacity
factor values as a percentage from 0-100.

{% block notable_irregularities %}
Non-county regions
------------------

The original data include capacity factors for some non-county areas including the Great
Lakes and 2 small cities (Bedford City, VA and Clifton Forge City, VA). It associated
"county" FIPS IDs with those areas, meaning that there was not a 1:1 relationship
between the FIPS IDs and the named areas, and the geographic region implied by the
FIPS IDs did not correspond to the named area. We've dropped the cities -- one of which
contained no data -- and set the FIPS codes for the Great Lakes to NA. Note that lakes
bordering multiple states will appear more than once in the data. VCE used a nearest
neighbor technique to assign the state waters to the counties (this pertains to coastal
areas as well).

Name and ID issues
------------------
* The place name for Lake Huron is misspelled "Hurron" in the original data.
* The place name for Lake Saint Claire in the original data uses the abbreviation "St."
  including the period character -- this is the only abbreviation and only non
  alphabetical or underscore character in any of the place names.
* In 2015 Shannon County, South Dakota was renamed Oglala Lakota County and assigned a
  new FIPS code. The VCE data includes the new FIPS code (46102) but the old name, while
  the Census DP1 dataset included with PUDL is from 2010, and so uses both the old name
  and the old FIPS code (46113).

Capacity factors > 1
--------------------
There are a couple of capacity factor values for the solar pv data that exceed
the maximum value of 1 for capacity factor (or 100 for the raw data--PUDL converts the
data from a percentage to a fraction to match other reported capacity factor data). This
is due to power production performance being correlated with panel temperatures. During
cold sunny periods, some solar capacity factor values are greater than 1 (but less that
1.1).

8760-hour years
---------------
This data is primarily used for modeling purposes and conforms to the 8760 hour/year
standard regardless of leap years. This means that 2020 is missing data for December
31st.
