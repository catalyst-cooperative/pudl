Form EIA-923 is known as the **Power Plant Operations Report**. The data include
electric power generation, energy source consumption, end of reporting period fossil
fuel stocks, as well as the quality and cost of fossil fuel receipts at the power
plant and prime mover level (with a subset of +10MW steam-electric plants reporting
at the boiler and generator level). Information is available for non-utility plants
starting in 1970 and utility plants beginning in 1999. The Form EIA-923 has evolved
over the years, beginning as an environmental add-on in 2007 and ultimately eclipsing
the information previously recorded in EIA-906, EIA-920, FERC 423, and EIA-423 by 2008.

As of 2019, the EIA-923 Form is organized into the following schedules:

* **Schedule 2:** fuel receipts and costs
* **Schedules 3A & 5A:** generator data including generation, fuel consumption and stocks
* **Schedule 4:** fossil fuel stocks
* **Schedules 6 & 7:** non-utility source and disposition of electricity
* **Schedules 8A-F:** environmental data

Some form of EIA-923 data stretches all the way back to 1970. PUDL coverage starts in
2001. Before 2001, the data like that contained in the EIA-923 was collected via
EIA-867, EIA-906, and EIA-920. Prior to 2008 fuel receipts and costs data were reported
in `EIA Form 423
<https: //www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia423 />`__ (which in turn
replaced the earlier FERC Form 423). If you're interested in this earlier data, get in
touch with us!

Monthly interim EIA-923 data are periodically integrated into PUDL as well. Incomplete
year-to-date data are excluded from the annualized tables to avoid confusion. We
have not yet integrated tables reporting fuel stocks, data from Puerto Rico, or EIA-923
schedules 6, 7, and 8.

{% block fill_out_form %}
Respondents include all all electric and CHP plants, and in some cases fuel transfer
terminals, that have a total generator nameplate capacity (sum for generators at a
single site) of 1 Megawatt (MW) or greater and are connected to the local or regional
electric power grid.

Selected plants may be permitted to report schedules 1-4B monthly and 6-8 annually so as
to lighten their reporting burden. All other respondents must respond to the Form in its
entirety once a year.

Once the respondents have submitted their responses, the EIA creates a series of
spreadsheets that reflect themes within the form. These spreadsheets have changed over
the years as the form itself evolves. They are accessible on the `EIA website <{{
source.path }}>`__ as downloadable ZIP files categorized by year. The internal data are
organized into excel spreadsheets. To gain greater insight into year-to-year nuances of
the form, we recommend downloading multiple years of EIA-923 ZIP files and comparing
both the Form and the Form Instructions files.

**File Naming Conventions**
The naming conventions for the raw files are confusing and difficult to trace year to
year. Subtle and not so subtle changes to the form and published spreadsheets make
aggregating pre-2009 data difficult from a programmatic standpoint.

**Protected Data**
In accordance with the Freedom of Information Act and the Trade Secrets Act, certain
information reported to EIA-923 may remain undisclosed to the public until three months
after its collection date. The fields subject to this legislation include: total
delivered cost of coal, natural gas, and petroleum received at non-utility power plants
and the commodity cost information for all plants (Schedule 2).

**Net generation & fuel consumed reported in two separate tables**
Net generation and fuel consumption are reported in two separate tables in EIA-923: in
the :ref:`generation_eia923` and :ref:`generation_fuel_eia923` tables. The
:ref:`generation_fuel_eia923` table is more complete (the :ref:`generation_eia923` table
includes only ~55% of the reported MWh), but the :ref:`generation_eia923` table is more
granular (it is reported at the generator level).

**Data Estimates**
Plants that did not respond or reported unverified data were recorded as estimates
rolled in with the state/fuel aggregates values reported under the plant id 99999.
