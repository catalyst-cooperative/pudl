We've also created the following tables mapping manually assigned PUDL IDs to FERC
respondent IDs, enabling a connection between the FERC and EIA data sets.

{% block background %}
    The FERC Form 1, otherwise known as the **Electric Utility Annual Report**, contains
    financial and operating data for major utilities and licensees. Much of it is not
    publicly available anywhere else.

With the new XBRL format we are in the process of integrating the data into
the full PUDL ETL pipeline. Previously, with the Visual FoxPro filings we had
integrated 7 tables into the pipeline. We focused on the tables pertaining to
power plants, their capital & operating expenses, and fuel consumption. We hope
to soon be able to pull just about any other table.

{% block fill_out_form %}
As outlined in the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Public
Utilities and Licensees Subject To the Provisions of The Federal Power Act (18 C.F.R.
Part 101), to qualify as a respondent, entities must exceed at least one of the
following criteria for three consecutive years prior to reporting:

* 1 million MWh of total sales
* 100MWh of annual sales for resale
* 500MWh of annual power exchanges delivered
* 500MWh of annual wheeling for others (deliveries plus losses)

Annual responses are due in April of the following year. FERC typically releases the
new data in October.

As of early 2021, the data is now published as a collection of XBRL filings. Previous
data remains in Visual FoxPro databases. The new data remains difficult to access and we
are in the process of understanding the underlying data and integrating this new format
into PUDL.

Previously the data was strutured as follows:

The data is published as a collection of Visual FoxPro databases: one per year
beginning in 1994. The databases all share a very similar structure and contain a total
of 116 data tables and ~8GB of raw data (though 90% of that data is in 3 tables
containing binary data). The `final release of Visual FoxPro was v9.0 in 2007
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro>`__. Its `extended support period ended
in 2015 <https://www.foxpro.co.uk/foxpro-end-of-life-and-you/>`__. The bridge
application which allowed this database to be used in Microsoft Access has been
discontinued. FERC's use of this database format creates a significant
barrier to data access.

New data is released as a collection of XBRL filings and we are in the process of
integrating this data into PUDL.

The FERC 1 database is poorly normalized and the data itself does not appear to be
subject to much quality control. For more detailed context and documentation on a
table-by-table basis, look at :doc:`/data_dictionaries/ferc1_db`.

{% block notable_irregularities %}
Sadly, the FERC Form 1 database is not particularly... relational. The only
foreign key relationships that exist map ``respondent_id`` fields in the
individual data tables back to ``f1_respondent_id``. In theory, most of the
data tables use ``report_year``, ``respondent_id``, ``row_number``,
``spplmnt_num`` and ``report_prd`` as a composite primary key.

In practice, there are several thousand records (out of ~12 million), including some
in almost every table, that violate the uniqueness constraint on those primary keys.
Since there aren't many meaningful foreign key relationships anyway, rather than
dropping the records with non-unique natural composite keys, we chose to preserve all
of the records and use surrogate auto-incrementing primary keys in the cloned SQLite
database.

Lots of the data included in the FERC tables is extraneous and difficult to parse. None
of the tables have record identification and they sometimes contain multiple rows
pertaining to the same plant or portion of a plant. For example, a utility might report
values for individual plants as well as the sum total, rendering any aggregations
performed on the column inaccurate. Sometimes there are values reported for the total
rows and not the individual plants making them difficult to simply remove. Moreover,
these duplicate rows are incredibly difficult to identify.

To improve their usability, we have developed a complex system of regional mapping in
order to create ids for each of the plants that can then be compared to PUDL ids and
used for integration with EIA and other data. We also remove many of the duplicate rows
and are in the midst of executing a more thorough review of the extraneous rows.

Over time we will pull in and clean up additional FERC Form 1 tables. If there's data
you need from Form 1 in bulk, you can `hire us <https://catalyst.coop/hire-catalyst/>`__
to liberate it first.
