The `SEC Form 10-K <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_10-K>`__ includes detailed
financial statements for publicly listed US companies. Most of this data is available in
the structured, machine-readable `XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Lanugae)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBRL> format. However, some common attachments to the
10-K have not been integrated into the XBRL reporting and are available only as
unstructured PDFs or HTML.

Our main interest in the SEC Form 10-K is providing better access to some of that
unstructured data, primarily an attachment called Exhibit
21 which reports "Subsidiaries of the Registrant" as described in `17 CFR ยง 229.601
<https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/229.601>`__.

    List all subsidiaries of the registrant, the state or other jurisdiction of
    incorporation or organization of each, and the names under which such subsidiaries
    do business. This list may be incorporated by reference from a document which
    includes a complete and accurate list.

This data is relevant to the US energy system and the transition away from fossil fuels
because electricity and natural gas utility holding companies often have complex
ownership relationships that tie together the economic and political interests of many
nested parent and subsidiary companies. Without understanding that network of
relationships, it is hard to understand the incentives driving the behavior of
individual utilities.

In 2024 we captured a snapshot of the raw HTML of the SEC 10-K filings, and any
associated Exhibit 21 attachments and processed it using the machine learning pipeline
found in `this repository <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/mozilla-sec-eia>`__.

Metadata related to the filing was parsed out of the plaintext headers of the HTML
documents. Some of these headers pertain to the filing as a whole and others describe
attributes of the individual companies associated with the filing. Each filing has a
single company that is the primary filer and the filing is associated with their
`Central Index Key <https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/cik-lookup>`__ (CIK) -- a
persistent company identifier assigned by the SEC that is more durable and standardized
than the company name.

These plaintext headers are not necessarily intended to be machine readable, but they
are highly structured and are the source material for most of the ``core_sec10k``
tables.

The SEC filing database is called EDGAR. The agency provides an `online search interface
<https://www.sec.gov/search-filings>`__ for all filings as well as `a REST API
<https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/edgar-application-programming-interfaces>`__ and
`several RSS feeds <https://www.sec.gov/about/rss-feeds>`__.

Who da fuck reports the 10-K?

{% block original_data %}

The original data is a collection of HTML documents with custom plaintext SEC headers.
The PUDL output tables contain a field ``source_url`` which points to these original
documents as plain text on the SEC website. `See this filing as an example
<https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1058624/0001104659-09-021814.txt>`__.
