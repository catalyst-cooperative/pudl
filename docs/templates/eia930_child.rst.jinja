The EIA Form 930 provides hourly operating data about the high-voltage bulk electric
power grid in the Lower 48 states. See the `official EIA-930 documentation
<https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/about>`__ for additional details.

The EIA-930 6-month consolidated CSVs contain the following hourly data elements:

* Demand (MWh)
* Demand by subregion (available for select BAs beginning 2018-07-01)
* Day ahead demand forecasts
* Net generation (MWh)
* Net generation by energy source (beginning 2018-07-01)
* Total net interchange (MWh)
* Interchange with adjacent BAs (MWh)

Additional CO2 emissions data is available through the per-BA Excel spreadsheet data,
**but these spreadsheet data have not (yet) been integrated into PUDL**:

* Estimated total CO2 emissions (beginning 2018-07-01)
* Estimated CO2 emissions by fuel type (beginning 2018-07-01)
* Estimated CO2 emissions for electricity imports or exports (beginning 2018-07-01)

Demand and demand by subregion
------------------------------

Demand is a calculated value representing the amount of electricity load within a BA's
electric system. A BA derives its demand value by taking the total metered net
electricity generation within its electric system and subtracting the total metered net
electricity interchange occurring between the BA and its neighboring BAs.

For select BAs, demand by subregion data provide demand at a further level of geographic
disaggregation (for example, load zones, weather zones, operating company areas, local
BAs, etc.) within a BA's electric system. A BA's reporting demand by subregion section
below provides more information on subregions. A mapping of BA codes to their subregions
can be found in :ref:`core_eia__codes_balancing_authority_subregions`

Day-ahead demand forecast
-------------------------

Each BA produces a day-ahead electricity demand forecast for every hour of the next day.
These forecasts help BAs plan for and coordinate the reliable operation of their
electric system.

Net generation
--------------

Net generation represents the metered output of electric generating units in a BA's
electric system. This generation only includes generating units that are managed by a BA
or whose operations are visible to a BA.

Generators on the distribution system—both large-scale resources and small-scale
distributed resources, such as rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems—are typically not
included.

BAs report generation from dual-fuel (switching from one fuel to another) and
multiple-fuel (using multiple fuels simultaneously) generators under the actual energy
source used, if known, and under the generator's primary energy source, if not known.

To maintain generator confidentiality, generation may sometimes be reported in the Other
category if too few generators are reported for a particular energy source category.

In some of our electricity publications, we report generation from all utility-scale
generating units in the United States. BAs only meter generating units that are from a
subset of all utility-scale generating units. As a result, when hourly generation from
the EIA-930 data is aggregated to monthly or annual levels, the results will be lower
than monthly and annual aggregations in other electricity publications.

Total interchange and interchange with adjacent BAs
---------------------------------------------------

Interchange is the net metered tie line flow from one BA to another directly
interconnected BA. Total net interchange is the net sum of all interchange occurring
between a BA and its directly interconnected neighboring BAs.

Negative interchange values indicate net inflows, and positive interchange values
indicate net outflows.

{% block availability %}
With the exception of the hourly CO2 emisisons data, all of the data mentioned above is
available through PUDL (demand, day ahead demand forecasts, demand by subregion, net
generation, net generation by energy source, total net interchange, and interchange by
adjacent BA)

{% block respondents %}

The EIA-930 data is collected from electricity balancing authorities (BAs) that operate
the grid.  Balancing authorities are a functional role defined by the `North American
Electric Reliability Corporation <https://www.nerc.com>`__ (NERC), and are mainly
responsible for balancing electricity supply, demand, and interchange on their electric
systems in real time.

{% endblock %}

{% block original_data %}

EIA publishes several versions of the Form 930:

* Bulk CSVs each of which cover six months of data for all BAs (**this is the data
  integrated into PUDL**)
* Per-BA Excel spreadsheets with additional CO2 emissions data and other detailed
  information about outlying values (not yet used by PUDL).
* A REST API.

{% block notable_irregularities %}

Be sure to check out `the official EIA-930 documentation <https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/about>`__.

EIA publishes the original raw data as it is supplied by the balancing authorities, and
it includes many irregularities including oulying and missing values, which they attempt
to manage in their aggregated (daily or nationwide) data, but which are present in the
original reported data.

Inconsistent interchange
------------------------

Balancing authorities do not always report symmetric, internally consistent interchange.
For example, entity A might report receiving 100 MWh of energy from entity B, while
entity B only reports sending 50 MWh of energy to entity A, so the data as reported do
not satisfy conservation of energy, and may need additional processing for use as
energy system modeling constraints.

Localization of timestamps
--------------------------

In the raw EIA-930 data both UTC and local timestamps are provided. We have retained
only the UTC times, because the timezones used by the balancing authorities do not
always correspond to their physical location, and the localized times include gaps and
duplicate hours due to daylight savings time shifts. The reporting timezone used by each
BA can be found in the :ref:`core_eia__codes_balancing_authorities` table, and can be
used to re-localize the UTC timestamps if needed.

Inconsistent totals
-------------------

See PR :pr:`3584` and `this comment <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/pull/3584#issuecomment-2080346566>`__
for an exploration of the following irregularities:

* In some cases the sum of reported net generation by energy source does not equal the
  total reported net generation for a BA. In most cases it's close, but for some BAs
  (typically the smaller ones) it can be off by factor of 10 or more.
* The sum of reported demand by subregion is very close to being equal to the total
  demand for a BA, but the correspondence isn't perfect.
* The sum of reported interchange with adjacent BAs does not always equal the total net
  interchange for a BA.
* Directly calculating demand as the total net generation minus interchange sometimes
  results in very different values than the reported demand.

BA consolidations and retirements
---------------------------------

Many smaller balancing authorities have been consolidated into larger organizations over
the years, especially into the Southwest Power Pool and MISO. As a result there are a
number of historical BA codes that **also** appear in the BA subregion codes. Compare
these tables:

* :ref:`core_eia__codes_balancing_authorities`
* :ref:`core_eia__codes_balancing_authority_subregions`

Pseudo-ties and dynamic scheduling
----------------------------------

Form EIA-930 data attempts to represent, as purely as possible, a physical picture of
supply, demand, and energy flow (interchange) on the U.S. electric grid. For the
purposes of Form EIA-930, interchange is the physical flow of electricity metered at the
tie line boundaries between electric systems. Net generation is a metered value of the
output of generating units in the BA. Demand (or load) is a calculated value based on
the activity occurring within the tie line boundaries of the electric system.

This physical picture of BA operations is not the way many electric systems account for
and report how they dispatch their generators, manage interchange, and balance their
systems. Utilities sometimes enter into commercial arrangements with other systems
including:

* **Dynamic scheduling:** the dispatch of generating units located in one system to
  serve customers in another systems
* **Pseudo-ties:** the transfer of electric energy through virtual interchange, where no
  direct physical connections exist between the two systems.

If operating data were reported with these commercial arrangements incorporated, then:

* Demand might include demand served outside the BA's tie line boundaries or exclude
  internal demand served by other BAs
* Net generation might include the output of generating units outside the BA's tie line
  boundaries or might exclude the output of internal units dispatched by other systems.
* Energy flows might be reported between BAs that are not directly interconnected.

BA Codes and Names
------------------

Note that the BA codes that appear in the EIA-930 are based on official NERC BA codes
and so may not match the current full name of BAs because of changes in corporate
ownership, mergers, or other business transactions.
