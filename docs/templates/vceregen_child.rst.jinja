{% block availability %}
The hourly, county-level data from 2019 - 2023 is integrated into PUDL. There is a
second release of data for the years 2014 - 2018 expected in Q1 of 2025. This may or
may not be integrated into PUDL depending on the willingness of Vibrant Pattern Energy.

IS THERE 3KM SPATIAL or other prop. data avail??

This data does not come from a government agency, and is not the result of compulsory
data reporting.

{% block original_data %}
The data were distributed as proprietary CSVs until fall 2024 when VPE decided to
publish the data through PUDL for public consumption.

The contents of the original CSVs are stripped down so that Excel can display the
data without crashing. There's one file per year per generation type, and each
file contains an index column for time (simply 0, 1, 2, 3... to
represent UTC hours in a year--a timeseries column takes up more space) and
columns for each county populated with capacity factor values from 0-1.

PUDL creates a timeseries column, adds spatial data, and combines these into a
single table stored as parquet files.
