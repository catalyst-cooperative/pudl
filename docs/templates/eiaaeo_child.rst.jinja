The Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) is a report published by EIA detailing the projected
state of energy consumption and supply in the US stretching out to 2050. The EIA
generates the data by updating and running a suite of `input data <https://github.com/EIAgov/NEMS/tree/main/input/emm/emm_db>`__
through their `National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) <https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/documentation/>`__,
actively updating the model to accommodate new scenarios and legislation. The
resulting data represent a wide range of potential outcomes for the US energy sector
based on a set of key assumptions.

Projections are published annually, with even years featuring full documentation
and extensive supplemental scenarios, and odd years offering simpler, more concise
information. Typical scenarios include:

* Low and high economic growth
* Low and high oil and gas supply
* Low and high oil prices
* Low and high renewable costs

Alternative scenarios may explore potential policy impacts or other relevant changes.
However, it's important to note that the energy system and accompanying policy
landscape are changing rapidly, and AEO cannot capture all the complexities. For
instance, when designing model stipulations for a given year, only laws implemented
before the year are considered.

For more information about scenarios, policy assumptions, and more, visit `EIA's AEO webpage <https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/>`__.

{% block availability %}
PUDL has incorporated data from a small subset of AEO table based on input from the energy
modeling community. If there's a table you don't see but would like to, let us know or
consider contributing!

PUDL hosts AEO data from 2023 onwards. We haven't prioritized older years due to
the predictive (vs. definitive) nature of the data. Each year presents fresh, presumably
more accurate data than the previous year, so that's the information we focus on.

For a look back at historic projections, poke around the `AEO Retrospective Review <https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/retrospective/>`__
published after each even year.

{% block respondents %}
AEO data is created by EIA staff using outputs from NEMS. It does not originate from utility or
plant operator respondents like EIA or FERC form data.

{% block original_data %}
EIA publishes AEO data in several ways:

* Excel files by case and scenario
* An `interactive table viewer <https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/data/browser/#/?id=1-AEO2025&region=0-0&cases=ref2025~hm2025~lm2025~highprice~lowprice~highogs~lowogs~highZTC~lowZTC~nocaa111~alttrnp~aeo2023ref&start=2023&end=2050&f=A&sourcekey=0>`__
* As `bulk JSON files <https://www.eia.gov/opendata/bulk/manifest.txt>`__
  (**this is the data integrated into PUDL**)
