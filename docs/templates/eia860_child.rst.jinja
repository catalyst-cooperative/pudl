Weâ€™ve also created the following entity tables modeled after EIA data collected from
multiple tables.

{% block background %}
EIA-860 is an annual form that collects utility, owner, plant, and generator-level data from existing
and planned entities with one or more megawatt of capacity. The form also contains
information regarding environmental control equipment and construction cost data from
2013-2018.

As of 2023, the EIA-860 Form is organized into the following schedules:

* **Schedule 1:** Identification
* **Schedule 2:** Power plant data
* **Schedule 3:** Generator information
* **Schedule 4:** Ownership of generators
* **Schedule 6:** Information on Boilers and Associated Equipment

(Schedule 5 contained generator construction cost information and was discontinued in 2018)

There is also a monthly survey known as the Monthly Update to Annual Electric Generator
Report (`EIA860M <https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860m/>`__) that provides sub-annual
updates to generator stats. The capacity values reported in 860M are often retroactively fixed
and are not considered as reliable as those in the annual form.

{% block availability %}
PUDL incorporates almost all EIA-860 data dating back to it's first publication in 2001.
Earlier data from the forms EIA-860A (utility) and EIA-860B (non-utility) exists for the
years 1990-2000, but is not yet included in PUDL.

Each quarter, PUDL also combines data from the most recent EIA-860M filing with
relevant EIA-860 tables. These records are marked with the ``monthly_update`` tag in the
``data_maturity`` field.

PUDL does not yet include the EIA-860 table for multi-fuel generators (Schedule 3.5).

{% block respondents %}
Respondents include all existing and proposed plants that have a total generator
nameplate capacity (sum for generators at a single site) of 1 Megawatt (MW) or greater
and are connected to the local or regional electric power grid. Annual responses are due
between the beginning of January and the end of February.

Jointly owned plants must be reported only once by their operator or planned operator.

{% block original_data %}

From 2001-2003 the data was distributed as VisualFoxPro DBF files. Starting in
2004 the data is distributed as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.

EIA typically publishes 860 data from the prior year in two rounds: an early release in
the summer and a final release in the fall. The data are published on the EIA
website and distributed as a collection of spreadsheets with multiple tabs. The content of
the spreadsheets varies from year to year as the questions in the form are updated.
EIA also periodically changes the naming and structure of the spreadsheets without
warning. Older "final" data may also be revised several years after it was published.
To ensure reproducible analyses, we archive `versioned snapshots of the
EIA-860 data on Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4127026>`__. These archives are
periodically refreshed with new data from the `EIA website <{{ source.path }}>`__.

To understand the details of how the form and data have evolved over time, we recommend
reading the Form Instructions from different years, linked above.

{% block notable_irregularities %}

* Prior to 2009, the Generators table was split into two spreadsheets: one for operating
  and one for proposed generation.
* In 2007 and before, there was an additional file for proposed changes to existing
  generation. The latter is excluded from PUDL while the former is combined into a
  single table during the transformation process.
* The Boiler Generator tab of Schedule 6.1 describes the associations between boilers and
  generators. These associations are important for calculating generation unit heat rates and
  thus fuel costs, because in EIA 923 net generation is reported by generators and fuel
  consumption is reported by boilers.

Unfortunately, the reported associations are incomplete. We've been able to infer many
more associations than those reported directly by EIA, and currently cover more than 95%
of the generation reported in the :ref:`core_eia923__monthly_generation` table. The associations
themselves are found in the :ref:`core_eia860__assn_boiler_generator` table.
