{% block background %}
In 2010 the US Census published its `Demographic Profile 1 (DP1)
<https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/2010/geo/tiger-data.html>`__ data in a
convenient geospatial database. This database included select demographic information at
the state, county, and census tract level, along with the geometries of those geographic
areas. The single file format was easy for us to archive and convert to SQLite for
integration with other data in PUDL early on in the project.

It continues to be a convenient source of state and county boundaries for use in mapping
and visualizations, and we use county-level population to provide context for the
FERC-714 hourly electricity demand. However, it should not be considered canonical
information since it's from 2010 and more recent analogous data is available from the
Census directly.

{% block availability %}
While the Census continues to compile similar demographic summary data, it has not
published subsequent versions in the same single-file geodatabase format that was used
for the 2010 data. As a result we have not updated this dataset since its initial
integration into PUDL in 2020.

`Census APIs <https: //www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html>`__.

{% block notable_irregularities %}
* The Census DP1 data we are using dates from the 2010 census. Jurisdiction boundaries,
  names, and IDs associated with individual counties and census tracts do change over
  time, so this data contains some minor discrepancies with present-day names, IDs, and
  boundaries. The population estimates and other demographic information it contains is
  also out of date. If you need more accurate geometries and demographics, you should go
  directly to canonical US Census data sources.
