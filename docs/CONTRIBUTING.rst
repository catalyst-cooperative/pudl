Welcome! We're excited that you're interested in contributing to the Public Utility
Data Liberation effort!

We need lots of help with :ref:`user-feedback`, we welcome :ref:`code-contribs`, and
it would be great to :ref:`connect-orgs` that we can work with.

Finally, `financial donations

Code of Conduct

Please make sure you review our :doc:`code of conduct <code_of_conduct>`, which is

want to make the PUDL project welcoming to contributors with different levels of
experience and diverse personal backgrounds.

User feedback

PUDL's goal is to help people use data to make change in the US energy landscape.
As such, it's critical that we understand our users' needs! `GitHub Discussions
<https://github.com/orgs/catalyst-cooperative/discussions>`__ is our main forum
for all this. Since it's publicly readable, any conversation here can
potentially benefit other users too!

We'd love it if you could:

* Tell us what problems you're running into, in the `Help Me!
  <https://github.com/orgs/catalyst-cooperative/discussions/categories/help-me>`__
  discussion board
* Tell us about what data you're looking for by opening an `issue
  <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new-data&projects=&template=new_dataset.md&title=>`__
* Tell us what you're trying to do with PUDL data in `this thread
  <https://github.com/orgs/catalyst-cooperative/discussions/3105>`__
* `File bug reports <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues/new?template=bug_report.md>`__ on Github.
* Tell us what you'd like to see in PUDL in the `Ideas
  <https://github.com/orgs/catalyst-cooperative/discussions/categories/ideas>`__
  discussion board

For PUDL to make a bigger impact, we need to find more people who need the data.
Here's how you can help:

* Cite PUDL using `DOIs from Zenodo
  <https://zenodo.org/communities/catalyst-cooperative/>`__ if you use the
  software or data in your own published work.
* Point us toward appropriate grant funding opportunities and meetings where
  we might present our work.
* Point us at interesting publications related to open energy data, open source
  energy system modeling, how energy policy can be affected by better data, or
  open source tools we should check out.
* Share your Jupyter notebooks and other analyses that use PUDL.
* `Hire Catalyst <https://catalyst.coop/hire-catalyst/>`__ to do analysis for
  your organization using the PUDL data -- contract work helps us self-fund
  ongoing open source development.
