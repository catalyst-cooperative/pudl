Contributing to PUDL
===============================================================================

Welcome! We're excited that you're interested in contributing to the Public Utility
Data Liberation effort! The work is currently being coordinated by the members of the
`Catalyst Cooperative <https://catalyst.coop>`__. PUDL is meant to serve a wide
variety of public interests including academic research, climate advocacy, data
journalism, and public policy making. This open source project has been supported by
a combination of volunteer contributions, grant funding from the `Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation <https://sloan.org>`__, and reinvestment of net income from the
cooperative's client projects.

Please make sure you review our :doc:`code of conduct <code_of_conduct>`, which is
based on the `Contributor Covenant <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/>`__. We
want to make the PUDL project welcoming to contributors with different levels of
experience and diverse personal backgrounds.

How to Get Involved
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We welcome just about any kind of contribution to the project. Alone, we'll never be
able to understand every use case or integrate all the available data. The project
will serve the community better if other folks get involved.

There are lots of ways to contribute -- it's not all about code!

* Ask questions on Github using the `issue tracker <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues>`__.
* `Suggest new data and features <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues/new?template=feature_request.md>`__ that would be useful.
* `File bug reports <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues/new?template=bug_report.md>`__ on Github.
* Help expand and improve the documentation, or create new
  `example notebooks <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl-examples/>`__
* Help us create more and better software :doc:`test cases <dev/testing>`.
* Give us feedback on overall usability -- what's confusing?
* Tell us a story about how you're using of the data.
* Point us at interesting publications related to open energy data, open source energy
  system modeling, how energy policy can be affected by better data, or open source
  tools we should check out.
* Cite PUDL using
  `DOIs from Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/communities/catalyst-cooperative/>`__
  if you use the software or data in your own published work.
* Point us toward appropriate grant funding opportunities and meetings where
  we might present our work.
* Share your Jupyter notebooks and other analyses that use PUDL.
* `Hire Catalyst <https://catalyst.coop/hire-catalyst/>`__ to do analysis for
  your organization using the PUDL data -- contract work helps us self-fund
  ongoing open source development.
* Contribute code via
  `pull requests <https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests>`__.
  See the :doc:`developer setup <dev/dev_setup>` for more details.
* And of course... we also appreciate
  `financial contributions <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=PZBZDFNKBJW5E&source=url>`__.

.. seealso::

    * :doc:`dev/dev_setup` for instructions on how to set up the PUDL
      development environment.

Find us on GitHub
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Github is the primary platform we use to manage the project, integrate
contributions, write and publish documentation, answer user questions, automate
testing & deployment, etc.
`Signing up for a GitHub account <https://github.com/join>`__
(even if you don't intend to write code) will allow you to participate in
online discussions and track projects that you're interested in.

Asking (and answering) questions is a valuable contribution! As noted in `How to
support open-source software and stay sane
<https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02046-0>`__, it's much more efficient to
ask and answer questions in a public forum because then other users and contributors
who are having the same problem can find answers without having to re-ask the same
question. The forum we're using is our `Github issues
<https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues>`__.

Even if you feel like you have a basic question, we want you to feel
comfortable asking for help in public -- we (Catalyst) only recently came to
this data work from being activists and policy wonks -- so it's easy for us to
remember when it all seemed frustrating and alien! Sometimes it still does. We
want people to use the software and data to do good things in the world. We
want you to be able to access it. Using a public forum also enables the
community of users to help each other!

Don't hesitate to open an issue with a `feature request
<https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues/new?template=feature_request.md>`__,
a pointer to energy data that needs liberating, or a reference to documentation
that's out of date, unclear, or missing. Understanding how people are using the
software, and how they would *like* to be using the software, is very valuable and
will help us make it more useful and usable.
