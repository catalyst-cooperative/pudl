Data Access
=======================================================================================

We publish the :doc:`PUDL pipeline <intro>` outputs in several ways to serve
different users and use cases. We're always trying to increase accessibility of the
PUDL data, so if you have suggestions or questions please `open a GitHub issue
<https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues>`__ or email us at
pudl@catalyst.coop.

How Should You Access PUDL Data?

.. _access-datasette:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Datasette
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We provide web-based access to the PUDL data via a
`Datasette <https://datasette.io>`__ deployment at `<https://data.catalyst.coop>`__.

Datasette is an open source tool that wraps SQLite databases in an interactive
front-end. It allows users to browse database tables, select portions of them using
dropdown menus, build their own SQL queries, and download data to CSVs. It also
creates a REST API allowing the data in the database to be queried programmatically.
All the query parameters are stored in the URL, so you can also share links to the
data you've selected.

Note that only data which has been fully integrated into the SQLite databases are
available here. Currently this includes `the core PUDL database
<https://data.catalyst.coop/pudl>`__ and our concatenation of `all historical FERC
Form 1 databases <https://data.catalyst.coop/ferc1>`__.

.. _access-zenodo:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zenodo Archives
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use Zenodo to archive our fully processed data as a SQLite databasees and
Parquet files. We also archive a Docker image that contains the software environment
required to use PUDL within Jupyter Notebooks. You can find all our archived data
products in `the Catalyst Cooperative Community on Zenodo
<https://zenodo.org/communities/catalyst-cooperative/>`__.

* The current (beta) version of the archived data and Docker container can be
  downloaded from `This Zenodo archive <https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/764417>`__
* Detailed instructions on how to access the archived PUDL data using a Docker
  container can be found in our `PUDL Examples repository
  <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl-examples/>`__.
* The SQLite databases and Parquet files containing the PUDL data, the complete FERC 1
  database, and EPA CEMS hourly data are contained in that same archive, if you want
  to access them directly without using PUDL.

.. note::

   If you're already familiar with Docker, you can also pull
   `the image we use <https://hub.docker.com/r/catalystcoop/pudl-jupyter>`__ to run
   Jupyter directly:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ docker pull catalystcoop/pudl-jupyter:latest

.. _access-jupyterhub:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JupyterHub
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've set up a `JupyterHub <https://jupyter.org/hub>`__ in collaboration with
`2i2c.org <https://2i2c.org>`__ which provides access to all of the processed PUDL
data and the software environment required to work with it. You don't have to
download or install anything to use it, but we do need to create an account for you.

* Request an account by submitting `this form <https://forms.gle/TN3GuE2e2mnWoFC4A>`__.
* Once we've created an account for you
  `follow this link <https://bit.ly/pudl-examples-01>`__ to log in and open up the first
  example notebook on the JupyterHub.
* You can create your own notebooks and upload, save, and download modest amounts of
  data on the hub.

We can only offer a small amount of memory (4-6GB) and processing power (1 CPU) per
user on the JupyterHub for free. If you need to work with lots of data or do
computationally intensive analysis, you may want to look into using the
:ref:`access-zenodo` option on your own computer. The JupyterHub uses exactly the
same data and software environment as the Zenodo Archives. Eventually we also want to
offer paid access to the JupyterHub with plenty of computing power.

.. _access-development:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Development Environment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to run the PUDL data processing pipeline yourself from scratch, run the
software tests, or make changes to the source code, you'll need to set up our
development environment. This is a bit involved, so it has its
:doc:`own separate documentation <dev/dev_setup>`.

Most users shouldn't need to do this, and will probably find working with the
pre-processed data via one of the other access modes easier. But if you want to
:doc:`contribute to the project <CONTRIBUTING>` please give it a shot!

.. _access-datapackage:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Packages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

    Prior to v0.4.0 of PUDL we only published processed data as `tabular data
    packages <https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/tabular-data-package/>`__. As of
    v0.4.0 we are will distribute the SQLite databases and Apache Parquet files
    alongside a set of data packages. As of PUDL v0.5.0 we will be generating SQLite
    and Apache Parquet outputs directly, and will no longer be archiving tabular data
    packages as the format of record, and the format conversions described below will
    no longer be necessary.

Archived Data Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We periodically publish data packages containing the full outputs from the PUDL ETL
pipeline on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`__, and open data archiving service provided
by CERN. The most recent release can always be found through this concept DOI:
`10.5281/zenodo.3653158 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3653158>`__. Each individual
version of the data releases will be assigned its own unique DOI.

All of our archived products can be found in the `Catalyst Cooperative Community on
Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/communities/catalyst-cooperative/>`__. These archives and
the DOIs associated with them should be permanently accessible, and are suitable for
use as references in academic and other publications.

Once you've downloaded or generated your own tabular data packages you will probably
want to convert them into a more analysis oriented file format. We typically use
SQLite for the core FERC and EIA data, and Apache Parquet files for the very long
tables like EPA CEMS.

Converting to SQLite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to access the data via SQL, we have provided a script that loads several
data packages into a local :mod:`sqlite3` database. Note that these data packages
**must** have all been generated by the **same** ETL run, or they will be considered
incompatible by the script. For example, to load three data packages generated by our
example ETL configuration into your local SQLite DB, you could run the following
command from within your PUDL workspace:

.. code-block:: console

    $ datapkg_to_sqlite \
        datapkg/pudl-example/ferc1-example/datapackage.json \
        datapkg/pudl-example/eia-example/datapackage.json \

Run ``datapkg_to_sqlite --help`` for more details.

Converting to Apache Parquet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :doc:`data_sources/epacems` data approaches 100 GB in size uncompressed, which is
too large to work with directly in memory on most systems, and take a very long time
to load into SQLite. Instead, we recommend converting the Hourly Emissions table into
an `Apache Parquet <https://parquet.apache.org>`__ dataset which is stored on disk
locally, and either reading in only parts of it using pandas, or using `Dask
dataframes <https://dask.org>`__, to serialize or distribute your analysis tasks.
Dask can also speed up processing for in-memory tasks, especially if you have a
powerful system with multiple cores, a solid state disk, and plenty of memory.

If you have generated an EPA CEMS data package, you can use the
``epacems_to_parquet`` script to convert the hourly emissions table like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ epacems_to_parquet datapkg/pudl-example/epacems-eia-example/datapackage.json

The script will automatically generate a Parquet Dataset which is partitioned
by year and state in the ``parquet/epacems`` directory within your workspace.
Run ``epacems_to_parquet --help`` for more details.
