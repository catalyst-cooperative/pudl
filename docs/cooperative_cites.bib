  abstract="To address social-environmental crises and corporate short-termism, the New Economics Foundation advocates rethinking corporate ownership and purpose. Cooperatives, being democratically managed, offer a model with potential for positive impact. Despite growing interest in platform cooperativism, software worker cooperatives remain under-explored. In this study, the first of its kind, we analyse 76 cooperative software businesses, and present insights based on interviews with members of 23 companies. Findings reveal that members are motivated by both practical benefits and ideological alignment with Social Economy values. These businesses promote workplace democracy, stakeholder engagement, and long-term value creation, though impact measurement remains a limited practice. With broader educational, institutional and governmental support, cooperatives could play a transformative role in the software sector.",

	abstract = {Digital Transformation and Cooperatives: Perspectives from the United Kingdom, Japan, and India reimagines the role of cooperatives in an increasingly digitised world. At a time when digital innovation is dominated by corporate paradigms, this pioneering volume positions cooperatives as ethical trailblazers capable of redefining technology’s purpose anchored in equity, participation, and mutual aid.
Bridging global case studies with cutting edge frameworks, the book introduces the Cooperative Digital Network (CDN) Theory and the Cooperative Digital Transformation Toolkit (CDTT), strategic tools designed to help cooperatives adopt digital technologies without compromising the cooperative Identity. From UK consumer co-ops to Japanese worker associations and India’s diverse grassroots movements, it explores how AI, blockchain, and IoT are being adapted to build inclusive, sustainable futures.
Through comparative analysis and practical innovations like the Cooperative Playbook and Coop Link 360 platform, the book offers a living blueprint for transformation, enabling knowledge sharing, digital upskilling, and peer-led innovation across continents. This is not just a book; it is a call to action for academics, practitioners, policymakers, and cooperative leaders to co-create a digital future where communities, not corporations, lead. Grounded in values and driven by vision, this work positions cooperatives as essential architects of a just, participatory digital age.},
