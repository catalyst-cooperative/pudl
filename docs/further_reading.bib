  abstract = {Scientific data have traditionally been distributed via downloads from data server
              to local computer. This way of working suffers from limitations as scientific
              datasets grow toward the petabyte scale. A “cloud-native data repository,” as
              defined in this article, offers several advantages over traditional data
              repositories-performance, reliability, cost-effectiveness, collaboration,
              reproducibility, creativity, downstream impacts, and access and inclusion. These
              objectives motivate a set of best practices for cloud-native data repositories:
              analysis-ready data, cloud-optimized (ARCO) formats, and loose coupling with
              data-proximate computing. The Pangeo Project has developed a prototype
              implementation of these principles by using open-source scientific Python tools. By
              providing an ARCO data catalog together with on-demand, scalable distributed
              computing, Pangeo enables users to process big data at rates exceeding 10 GB/s.
              Several challenges must be resolved in order to realize cloud computing's full
              potential for scientific research, such as organizing funding, training users, and
              enforcing data privacy requirements.},

  abstract  = {AI models are increasingly applied in high-stakes domains like health and
               conservation.  Data quality carries an elevated significance in high-stakes AI due
               to its heightened downstream impact, impacting predictions like cancer detection,
               wildlife poaching, and loan allocations. Paradoxically, data is the most
               under-valued and de-glamorised aspect of AI. In this paper, we report on data
               practices in high-stakes AI, from interviews with 53 AI practitioners in India,
               East and West African countries, and USA. We define, identify, and present
               empirical evidence on Data Cascades—compounding events causing negative,
               downstream effects from data issues—triggered by conventional AI/ML practices that
               undervalue data quality. Data cascades are pervasive (92% prevalence), invisible,
               delayed, but often avoidable. We discuss HCI opportunities in designing and
               incentivizing data excellence as a first-class citizen of AI, resulting in safer
               and more robust systems for all.},

  title     = {High energy burden and low-income energy affordability: conclusions from a literature review},
  abstract  = {In an era of U.S. energy abundance, the persistently high energy bills
               paid by low-income households is troubling. After decades of weatherization and
               bill-payment programs, low-income households still spend a higher percent of their
               income on electricity and gas bills than any other income group. Their energy burden
               is not declining, and it remains persistently high in particular geographies such as
               the South, rural America, and minority communities. As public agencies and utilities
               attempt to transition to a sustainable energy future, many of the programs that
               promote energy efficiency, rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and home batteries are
               largely inaccessible to low-income households due to affordability barriers. This
               review describes the ecosystem of stakeholders and programs, and identifies promising
               opportunities to address low-income energy affordability, such as behavioral
               economics, data analytics, and leveraging health care benefits. Scalable approaches
               require linking programs and policies to tackle the complex web of causes and impacts
               faced by financially constrained households.}

abstract = {Grid integration studies are key to understanding our ability to integrate
            variable generation resources into the power system and evaluating the
            associated costs and benefits. In these studies, it is important to
            understand the flexibility of the thermal power fleet, including how thermal
            plants operate at part load. Without a comprehensive understanding of
            thermal plant operation, we may over- or underestimate our ability to
            integrate variable generation resources and thus draw incomplete or
            inaccurate conclusions regarding their potential economic and environmental
            effects. The only public data source for understanding many elements of the
            operational characteristics of the thermal fleet is the U.S. Environmental
            Protection Agency Clean Air Markets database of historical power plant
            operation. However, though these data sets have been widely utilized, their
            use has proven to be difficult, and methods to clean and filter the data are
            not transparent. Here, we describe the database and a method to clean and
            filter it. We then use the cleaned database to demonstrate several
            characteristics of historical plant operation, including frequent part load
            operation.  Finally, we provide a cleaned data set with heat rate curves and
            describe how to use it in general modeling activities and analysis.}
