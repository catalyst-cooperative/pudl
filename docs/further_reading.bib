  abstract = {Scientific data have traditionally been distributed via downloads from data server
              to local computer. This way of working suffers from limitations as scientific
              datasets grow toward the petabyte scale. A “cloud-native data repository,” as
              defined in this article, offers several advantages over traditional data
              repositories-performance, reliability, cost-effectiveness, collaboration,
              reproducibility, creativity, downstream impacts, and access and inclusion. These
              objectives motivate a set of best practices for cloud-native data repositories:
              analysis-ready data, cloud-optimized (ARCO) formats, and loose coupling with
              data-proximate computing. The Pangeo Project has developed a prototype
              implementation of these principles by using open-source scientific Python tools. By
              providing an ARCO data catalog together with on-demand, scalable distributed
              computing, Pangeo enables users to process big data at rates exceeding 10 GB/s.
              Several challenges must be resolved in order to realize cloud computing's full
              potential for scientific research, such as organizing funding, training users, and

  abstract  = {AI models are increasingly applied in high-stakes domains like health and
               conservation.  Data quality carries an elevated significance in high-stakes AI due
               to its heightened downstream impact, impacting predictions like cancer detection,
               wildlife poaching, and loan allocations. Paradoxically, data is the most
               under-valued and de-glamorised aspect of AI. In this paper, we report on data
               practices in high-stakes AI, from interviews with 53 AI practitioners in India,
               East and West African countries, and USA. We define, identify, and present
               empirical evidence on Data Cascades—compounding events causing negative,
               downstream effects from data issues—triggered by conventional AI/ML practices that
               undervalue data quality. Data cascades are pervasive (92% prevalence), invisible,
               delayed, but often avoidable. We discuss HCI opportunities in designing and
               incentivizing data excellence as a first-class citizen of AI, resulting in safer
               and more robust systems for all.},

    action on climate. Many now hope that growing public concern will lead to greater
    policy ambition, but the most widely promoted strategy to address the climate crisis
    -- the use of market-based programs -- hasn't been working and isn't ready to scale.
    Danny Cullenward and David Victor show how the politics of creating and maintaining
    market-based policies render them ineffective nearly everywhere they have been
    applied. Reforms can help around the margins, but markets' problems are structural
    and won't disappear with increasing demand for climate solutions. Facing that
    reality requires relying more heavily on smart regulation and industrial policy --
    government-led strategies -- to catalyze the transformation that markets promise,
    but rarely deliver.

  abstract  = {In an era of U.S. energy abundance, the persistently high energy bills
               paid by low-income households is troubling. After decades of weatherization and
               bill-payment programs, low-income households still spend a higher percent of their
               income on electricity and gas bills than any other income group. Their energy burden
               is not declining, and it remains persistently high in particular geographies such as
               the South, rural America, and minority communities. As public agencies and utilities
               attempt to transition to a sustainable energy future, many of the programs that
               promote energy efficiency, rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and home batteries are
               largely inaccessible to low-income households due to affordability barriers. This
               review describes the ecosystem of stakeholders and programs, and identifies promising
               opportunities to address low-income energy affordability, such as behavioral
               economics, data analytics, and leveraging health care benefits. Scalable approaches
               require linking programs and policies to tackle the complex web of causes and impacts
               faced by financially constrained households.}

abstract = {Power system modeling is data intensive. In Europe, electricity system data
            is often available from sources such as statistical offices or system
            operators.  However, it is often unclear if these data can be legally used
            for modeling, and in particular if such use infringes intellectual property
            rights. This article reviews the legal status of power system data, both as
            a guide for data users and for data publishers. It is based on
            interpretation of the law, a review of the secondary literature, an analysis
            of the licenses used by major data distributors, expert interviews, and a
            series of workshops. A core finding is that in many cases the legality of
            current practices is doubtful: in fact, it seems likely that modelers
            infringe intellectual property rights quite regularly. This is true for
            industry analysis but also academic researchers. A straightforward solution
            is open data – the idea that data can be freely used, modified, and shared
            by anyone for any purpose. To be open, it is not sufficient for data to be
            accessible free of cost, it must also come with an open data license, the
            most common types of which are also reviewed in this paper.}

    efficient data cleaning solutions is challenging and is rife with deep theoretical
    and engineering problems.This book is about data cleaning, which is used to refer to
    all kinds of tasks and activities to detect and repair errors in the data. Rather
    than focus on a particular data cleaning task, we give an overview of the endto- end
    data cleaning process, describing various error detection and repair methods, and
    attempt to anchor these proposals with multiple taxonomies and views. Specifically,
    we cover four of the most common and important data cleaning tasks, namely, outlier
    detection, data transformation, error repair (including imputing missing values),
    and data deduplication. Furthermore, due to the increasing popularity and
    applicability of machine learning techniques, we include a chapter that specifically
    explores how machine learning techniques are used for data cleaning, and how data
    cleaning is used to improve machine learning models.This book is intended to serve
    as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners who are interested in the
    area of data quality and data cleaning. It can also be used as a textbook for a
    graduate course. Although we aim at covering state-of-the-art algorithms and
    techniques, we recognize that data cleaning is still an active field of research and
    therefore provide future directions of research whenever appropriate.}

abstract = {Large-scale deployment of solar photovoltaics (PV) contributes to the
    occurrence of depressed—and sometimes negative—electricity prices during daylight
    hours as PV displaces higher-cost generators in the merit-order dispatch stack.
    These changes in electricity price provide an opportunity to increase the wholesale
    energy revenue of PV generators through temporal shaping of PV output. Here, we
    explore the impact of three output-shaping strategies on PV wholesale energy revenue
    and capacity factor: utilization of 1-axis tracking, curtailment during
    negative-price hours, and modification of fixed-tilt array orientation.
    Utility-scale PV arrays are modeled at more than 10,000 pricing nodes across six
    United States electricity markets over the 2010–2017 time period. Large changes in
    revenue-optimized output profiles are observed for the California system, where
    solar capacity penetration has increased from ∼2% of peak load in 2010 to ∼28% of
    peak load in 2017, and the wholesale revenue benefits of temporal output shaping are
    increasing with time. On the California real-time market in 2017, compared to
    capacity-factor-optimized fixed-tilt arrays with must-run operation, curtailment
    increases revenues by 9%, curtailment in conjunction with fixed-tilt orientation
    optimization increases revenues by 20%, 1-axis tracking without curtailment
    increases revenues by 32%, and 1-axis tracking with curtailment increases revenues
    by 42% for the median node. Median optimal fixed-tilt azimuths for PV on the
    real-time market in California have increased from 192° in 2010 to 235° (i.e. 55°
    west of south) in 2017. Among the markets and years studied, the California market
    in 2017 demonstrates the largest potential benefit from temporal output shaping.
    These results highlight mechanisms for mitigating some of the decline in PV
    wholesale value at high solar penetrations, and illustrate the importance of
    adapting PV installation and dispatch strategies to changing power system
    conditions.}

abstract = {The cost of utility-scale photovoltaics (PV) has declined rapidly over the
    past decade. Yet increased renewable electricity generation, decreased natural gas
    prices, and deployment of emissions-control technology across the United States have
    led to concurrent changes in electricity prices and power system emissions rates,
    each of which influence the value of PV electricity. An ongoing assessment of the
    economic competitiveness of PV is therefore necessary as PV cost and value continue
    to evolve. Here, we use historical nodal electricity prices, capacity market prices,
    marginal power system emissions rates of CO2 and air pollutants, and weather data to
    model the energy, capacity, health, and climate value of PV electricity at over
    10 000 locations across six U.S. Independent System Operators (ISOs) from 2010 to
    2017. On the energy and capacity markets, transmission congestion in some locations
    and years results in PV revenues that are more than double the median across the
    relevant ISO. While the marginal public health benefits from avoided SO2, NOx, and
    PM2.5 emissions have declined over time in most ISOs, monetizing the health benefits
    of PV generation in 2017 would increase median PV energy revenues by 70% in MISO and
    NYISO and 100% in PJM. Given 2017 PV costs, electricity prices, and grid conditions,
    PV breaks even at 30% of modeled locations on the basis of energy, capacity, and
    health benefits, at 75% of modeled locations with the addition of a 50 $/ton CO2
    price, and at 100% of modeled locations with a 100 $/ton CO2 price. These results
    suggest that PV cost decline has outpaced value decline over the past decade, such
    that in 2017 the net benefits of utility-scale PV outweigh the cost at the majority
    of modeled locations.}

        Whereas scholars have typically modeled climate change as a global collective
        action challenge, we offer a dynamic theory of climate politics based on the
        present and future revaluation of assets. Climate politics can be understood
        as a contest between owners of assets that accelerate climate change, such
        as fossil fuel plants, and owners of assets vulnerable to climate change,
        such as coastal property. To date, obstruction by “climate-forcing” asset
        holders has been a large barrier to effective climate policy. But as climate
        change and decarbonization policies proceed, holders of both climate-forcing
        and “climate-vulnerable” assets stand to lose some or even all of their
        assets' value over time, and with them, the basis of their political power.
        This dynamic contest between opposing interests is likely to intensify in
        many sites of political contestation, from the subnational to transnational
        levels. As it does so, climate politics will become increasingly
        existential, potentially reshaping political alignments within and across
        countries. Such shifts may further undermine the Liberal International Order
        (LIO); as countries develop pro-climate policies at different speeds and
        magnitudes, they will have incentives to diverge from existing arrangements
        over trade and economic integration.}
