  abstract = {Scientific data have traditionally been distributed via downloads from data server
              to local computer. This way of working suffers from limitations as scientific
              datasets grow toward the petabyte scale. A “cloud-native data repository,” as
              defined in this article, offers several advantages over traditional data
              repositories-performance, reliability, cost-effectiveness, collaboration,
              reproducibility, creativity, downstream impacts, and access and inclusion. These
              objectives motivate a set of best practices for cloud-native data repositories:
              analysis-ready data, cloud-optimized (ARCO) formats, and loose coupling with
              data-proximate computing. The Pangeo Project has developed a prototype
              implementation of these principles by using open-source scientific Python tools. By
              providing an ARCO data catalog together with on-demand, scalable distributed
              computing, Pangeo enables users to process big data at rates exceeding 10 GB/s.
              Several challenges must be resolved in order to realize cloud computing's full
              potential for scientific research, such as organizing funding, training users, and
              enforcing data privacy requirements.},

  abstract  = {AI models are increasingly applied in high-stakes domains like health and
               conservation.  Data quality carries an elevated significance in high-stakes AI due
               to its heightened downstream impact, impacting predictions like cancer detection,
               wildlife poaching, and loan allocations. Paradoxically, data is the most
               under-valued and de-glamorised aspect of AI. In this paper, we report on data
               practices in high-stakes AI, from interviews with 53 AI practitioners in India,
               East and West African countries, and USA. We define, identify, and present
               empirical evidence on Data Cascades—compounding events causing negative,
               downstream effects from data issues—triggered by conventional AI/ML practices that
               undervalue data quality. Data cascades are pervasive (92% prevalence), invisible,
               delayed, but often avoidable. We discuss HCI opportunities in designing and
               incentivizing data excellence as a first-class citizen of AI, resulting in safer
               and more robust systems for all.},

  abstract = {For decades, the world's governments have struggled to move from talk to
    action on climate. Many now hope that growing public concern will lead to greater
    policy ambition, but the most widely promoted strategy to address the climate crisis
    -- the use of market-based programs -- hasn't been working and isn't ready to scale.
    Danny Cullenward and David Victor show how the politics of creating and maintaining
    market-based policies render them ineffective nearly everywhere they have been
    applied. Reforms can help around the margins, but markets' problems are structural
    and won't disappear with increasing demand for climate solutions. Facing that
    reality requires relying more heavily on smart regulation and industrial policy --
    government-led strategies -- to catalyze the transformation that markets promise,
    but rarely deliver.

  abstract  = {In an era of U.S. energy abundance, the persistently high energy bills
               paid by low-income households is troubling. After decades of weatherization and
               bill-payment programs, low-income households still spend a higher percent of their
               income on electricity and gas bills than any other income group. Their energy burden
               is not declining, and it remains persistently high in particular geographies such as
               the South, rural America, and minority communities. As public agencies and utilities
               attempt to transition to a sustainable energy future, many of the programs that
               promote energy efficiency, rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and home batteries are
               largely inaccessible to low-income households due to affordability barriers. This
               review describes the ecosystem of stakeholders and programs, and identifies promising
               opportunities to address low-income energy affordability, such as behavioral
               economics, data analytics, and leveraging health care benefits. Scalable approaches
               require linking programs and policies to tackle the complex web of causes and impacts
               faced by financially constrained households.}

            understand the flexibility of the thermal power fleet, including how thermal
            plants operate at part load. Without a comprehensive understanding of
            thermal plant operation, we may over- or underestimate our ability to

            Protection Agency Clean Air Markets database of historical power plant
            operation. However, though these data sets have been widely utilized, their
            use has proven to be difficult, and methods to clean and filter the data are
            not transparent. Here, we describe the database and a method to clean and

            characteristics of historical plant operation, including frequent part load
            operation.  Finally, we provide a cleaned data set with heat rate curves and

abstract = {Power system modeling is data intensive. In Europe, electricity system data
            is often available from sources such as statistical offices or system
            operators.  However, it is often unclear if these data can be legally used
            for modeling, and in particular if such use infringes intellectual property
            rights. This article reviews the legal status of power system data, both as
            a guide for data users and for data publishers. It is based on
            interpretation of the law, a review of the secondary literature, an analysis
            of the licenses used by major data distributors, expert interviews, and a
            series of workshops. A core finding is that in many cases the legality of
            current practices is doubtful: in fact, it seems likely that modelers
            infringe intellectual property rights quite regularly. This is true for
            industry analysis but also academic researchers. A straightforward solution
            is open data – the idea that data can be freely used, modified, and shared
            by anyone for any purpose. To be open, it is not sufficient for data to be
            accessible free of cost, it must also come with an open data license, the
            most common types of which are also reviewed in this paper.}

    dirty data often leads to inaccurate data analytics results and incorrect business
    decisions. Poor data across businesses and the U.S. government are reported to cost
    trillions of dollars a year. Multiple surveys show that dirty data is the most
    common barrier faced by data scientists. Not surprisingly, developing effective and
    efficient data cleaning solutions is challenging and is rife with deep theoretical
    and engineering problems.This book is about data cleaning, which is used to refer to
    all kinds of tasks and activities to detect and repair errors in the data. Rather
    than focus on a particular data cleaning task, we give an overview of the endto- end
    data cleaning process, describing various error detection and repair methods, and
    attempt to anchor these proposals with multiple taxonomies and views. Specifically,
    we cover four of the most common and important data cleaning tasks, namely, outlier
    detection, data transformation, error repair (including imputing missing values),
    and data deduplication. Furthermore, due to the increasing popularity and
    applicability of machine learning techniques, we include a chapter that specifically
    explores how machine learning techniques are used for data cleaning, and how data
    cleaning is used to improve machine learning models.This book is intended to serve
    as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners who are interested in the
    area of data quality and data cleaning. It can also be used as a textbook for a
    graduate course. Although we aim at covering state-of-the-art algorithms and
    techniques, we recognize that data cleaning is still an active field of research and
    therefore provide future directions of research whenever appropriate.}
