    "# Integrating New FERC Form 1 and EIA Data Releases\n",
    "This notebook generates lists of new plants and utilities that need to be assigned PUDL IDs. It helps with the process of integrating new data each fall when the agencies make their new annual release for the previous year.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites:\n",
    "* All available EIA 860/923 years must be loaded into your PUDL DB.\n",
    "* This includes the **new** year of data to be integrated.\n",
    "* This means the spreadsheet tab maps need to be updated.\n",
    "* Some minor EIA data wrangling may also be required.\n",
    "* All years of FERC Form 1 data must be loaded into your FERC 1 DB.\n",
    "* This includes the **new** year of data to be integrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs:\n",
    "* `unmapped_utilities_ferc1.csv`: Respondent IDs and respondent names of utilities which appear in the FERC Form 1 DB, but which do **not** appear in the PUDL ID mapping spreadsheet.\n",
    "* `unmapped_plants_ferc1.csv`: Plant names, respondent names, and respondent IDs associated with plants that appear in the FERC Form 1 DB, but which do **not** appear in the PUDL ID Mapping spreadsheet.\n",
    "* `unmapped_utilities_eia.csv`: EIA Utility IDs and names of utilities which appear in the PUDL DB, but which do **not** appear in the PUDL ID mapping spreadsheet.\n",
    "* `unmapped_plants_eia.csv`: EIA Plant IDs and Plant Names of plants which appear in the PUDL DB, but which do **not** appear in the PUDL ID mapping spreadsheet.  The Utility ID and Name for the primary plant operator, as well as the aggregate plant capacity and the state the plant is located in are also proved to aid in PUDL ID mapping.\n",
    "* `lost_utilities_eia.csv`: The Utility IDs and Names of utilities which appear in the PUDL ID mapping spreadsheet but which do **not** appear in the PUDL DB. Likely because EIA revised previous years of data, and removed those utilities, after we had mapped them.\n",
    "* `lost_plants_eia.csv`: The Plant IDs and Names of plants which appear in the PUDL ID mapping spreadsheet but which do **not** appear in the PUDL DB. Likely because EIA revised previous years of data, and removed those plants, after we had mapped them."
