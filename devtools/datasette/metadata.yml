      databases published between 1994 and 2019. It has been minimally altered
      to allow all years of data to coexist in the same database. It contains a
      wealth of data about the operating costs and financial structures of US
      electric utilities, much of which is not publicly available from any
      other source. It was produced by <a href="https://catalyst.coop">Catalyst

      Data Liberation Project</a>.</p>
