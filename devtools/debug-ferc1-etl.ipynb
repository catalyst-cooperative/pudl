    "# Working with the FERC Form 1 Extract / Transform\n",
    "This notebook steps through PUDL's extract and transform steps for FERC Form 1 to make it easier to test and add new years of data, or new tables from the various spreadsheets that haven't been integrated yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook deviates from other devtool debug notebooks in that it doesn't make use of the most recently created dagster asset values. Instead, the extraction and transforms steps are rerun within the notebook so we can inspect the outputs of lower level transform functions that don't have their own assets like `process_xbrl` and `transform_start`.\n",
